0,Samsung,"Samsung Galaxy M51 (Electric Blue, 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage)",5.0 out of 5 stars,"  At first glance it looks a bit bulky. Camera, display etc. are satisfactory. Overall GOOD non Chinese phone.However, for their improvement, I tried to give some critical feedback to the company over phone but it was not so easy, so, I am writing here sothat Samsung India can take this critical review for their improvement.Battery:Battery is 7K mha but it is draining so fast that its overall backup time is slightly better than any other average phone.User Interface:User interface needs tremendous improvement. You can't take screenshot easily. You need to learn fine motor coordination between your fingers and power&volume button with microsecond precision. After three days I discovered taking screenshot by swapping screen. But this easy method for taking screenshot is not easy to find in its setting section. Automatic redial isn't available. also in setting section, searching for basic operation like redial, call waiting etc are either missing or very difficult to access. UI should be more intelligent and intuitive. Call recording should take permission from user before it starts recording any call.Dolby Sound:Dolby sound effect is excellent but its available only for external speaker. Inbuilt speaker don't have Dolby effect. You hv to buy headphone or external speaker for experiencing Dolby sound effect. Its Dolby software is so impressive that its work on a cheapest headphone but Samsung's own inbuilt speaker doesn't.External Outlook:Read somewhere that this phone has 3D prism like glastic body. GLASTIC seems to be a discovery of new material (Glass+Plastic) because its looks transparent and shining. But in reality, its a cheap looking smooth and slippery plastic back body. Also, Its prone to scratches neither its water resistant. Sometimes it generates heat. In this price segment, Samsung can easily provide metallic back for better appearance and transfer of heat.Overall, its good non chini phone with good camera and display, a bit bulky, satisfactory speed, scope of tremendous improvement in UI and setting, and bit overpriced.

  Ok so here comes the first review of this phone. Ordered on the first day of its sale and received on 3rd day. Indeed its a big and bulky phn but easy to handle. Few highlights:1. Seamless fingerprint scanner. I hv heard tht recent samsung phns have ths issue , however i dnt see any in ths phn. Its as gud as my past phns Asus 6z and Vivo v15pro. Side fingerprint scanner on the power button really makes it stylish and too easy to handle as well.2. Camera quality is really gud wth many features which luks tempting which im yet to explore. Even in dim light it scores quite well. Have all latest features like slow mo, 10x zoom, focus lens, panorma view and other added features.3. Battery ofcourse was the highlight while buying ths phn. I received this phn at 43%. And even after a rigorous 3 hr session of data transfer and apps installation it still holds at 33%. I believe it gonna last 2 days easily wth heavy net usage , mild games and gud 2 hrs of talk time.4. Luks wise it does seem premium despite a plastic back.5. Wonderful touch and a decent processimg speed. I tried playing 7-8 apps at the same time and it never hanged or lagged despite 50% memory up. Yet to try on heavy games though.6. Front cam does spoil the fun while watching full screen videos, like a small black dot bt can be lived wth.7. No headphones in the box.8. C to C charging cable capable of reverse charging too.Overall i wld rate it 4/5. Its one of the best non chinese phn available in the market for those who r luking for a huge battery wth a decent cam and light gaming purpose.Wld update on battery and cam after few days of usage

  There's something wrong with the new Samsung M51 mobile. Many other users are also facing the same issue. We are unable to connect through Wi-Fi on Samsung M51.Meanest Monster Ever ... HahahahaThis meanest monster is performing poorly within 5 min of unboxing. My eight yr old Lenovo still works like charm with Wi-Fi.Issue: When you trying connecting through Wi-Fi, on giving correct password, it says ""Incorrect Password"".I have done every troubleshooting step suggested by Samsung Tech support:1. Forget the connection and reconnect again.2. Update the phone s/w to latest version.3. Reset Settings4. Reset Network Settings5. Factory Data ResetI have applied every step suggested by tech-support and the result is still the same.The most irritating thing is how can a company like Samsung mess-up such a basic feature & to the surprise, even the tech support has now run out of troubleshooting solutions.Instead of replacing it with new phone, tech support has now told me to get the hardware fixed from Samsung Service centre. I don't get it why should I take a brand new phone to service center & get it opened. Instead a replacement of this phone should be there, I have not even used it for more than an hour.Last year I ordered an MI phone from Flipkart, the battery was getting drained very fast. Within the next day, the phone was replaced without questions asked.Dissappointed by Amazon, the way they are handling this issue.Don't spend your hard-earned money on this phone. Unfortunately, if your phone turns-out to be faulty, then there is a never ending process to take care of issue.

  After using for more than 2 day's I must say, snapdragon 730g works wonderful .CAMERA.This time M series did a honest job by giving us a INTELLI camera of 64 mega Pixcel and more feature in selfie camera.DISPLAY & FINGERPRINT.With Samsung SuperAmoled display you can truly trust the amazing view angle. Now in M51 feature of Widevine L Certification you can enjoy all those global Dolby theatre experience. I found it reliable for my 1920p to 4k level of movie watching without any distraction due to Infinite O display which gives Full Screen Ratio. Fingerprint on side is much faster than I expected. It doesn't takes a second also to open. Even FaceUnlock is faster.Superior, as it matches any S series flagship premium in classy look, strong built for this budget amount. 6.7 inches display is good to handle as it is well managed for one hand use also.

  I am giving this review after spending 20 days with this Phone. I am a retail user and after 6 year of redmi and realme user now buy the Samsung just because of Samsung+Snapdragon and very much dispointed. Here are some Pros and Cons which will help other user like me to decide whether they will buy it or not.Cons :1. No Haptic Feedback2. Low sound quality speaker at Rs 25K3. No apps lock features inbuilt4. No Case Cover in Box5. Plain Plastic back design at 25K which attract too much scratches.6. Samsung trusted Knox security not fully enable on this phone i.e no secure folder option.7. When Sealed Package open then phone display contain so much dust. Not expected the packaging like this from brand like Samsung.8. Gorila Glass 3 protection under 25k i.e out dated glass protection after using 2 days with full care i got one scratch mark on display.9. NFC given but Samsung Pay not there in this phone.10. Audio output in my boat rockers bluetooth headset with this phone is not as much as lound as compare to my previous phone Redmi Note 7 pro.11. Without using phone it take 2 hour to charge but when you use it frequently then it take 2.30-3 hour to charged it full from 0-100%.12. Full battery drained in 12 hour with non stop used including youtube, whatsapp Facebook, messaging, etc except game.13. No Carrier aggregation: Using Jio sim in Samsung M51 and realme X2 pro and both contain different net speed in which Samsung giving me 5mbps and realme x2 pro giving me 9-10mbps.14. Calling issue: while talking through ear piece on call, the person can hear my voice clearly. But if i put the call on loudspeaker, the receiver of call cant hear my voice or he hear my sound very low. Turning back to earpiece the person is able to hear me again.15. Camera Zoom quality is not good. When you focus on Sky whole pic turn into blue. i.e saturation level is too much high in this phone (Image attached).16. While watching movie video in this phone or playing video in youtube brightness fluctuate fast too much automatically i.e Adaptive Brightness issue.Pros :1. Super amoled plus display2. Camera quality Good3. 7000 Mah battery4. Till now Ram management is goodTo much hype created every where for this phone and due to this many user like me has purchased this phone but this phone under 25k is really not value for money. I am going to resale this phone. There are so many phone below 25k with best facilities as compare to this Samsung m51.Conclusion : Phone is overpriced and performance is average

  This is a perfect mobile for you,1. If you properly read the spec before buying this mobile2. If you don't expect all iPhone features in this mobile,3. if you are not a addictive gamer,4. If you don't expect your mobile to be a speaker,5. If you do concern about your data handled in Chinese mobiles,6. If you need better SAR value,7. If your first preference is battery, and decent level of camera quality,8. If you need all trending features to be covered in non Chinese mobile,THEN GO FOR IT... ALSO TRY TO UPDATE TO LATEST SOFTWARE ONCE AFTER SETTING UP YOUR MOBILE, OTHERWISE HEATING ISSUE WILL BE THERE.

  It has issue with camera in night mode and pro mode.It seems like there is dust present on camera sensor which is only visible in dark photos. When photo is clicked with lens covered completely,  it shows hundreds of white spots in image, same happens with pro mode too. (This is not regular image noise)

  This is best thing you can get at this price from a reputed brand with Made in India tag. First time I ordered on the first day of online launch and am happy. I'm writing after few days of usage, but this should not be different as my experience with Samsung has been most consistent as compared to other mobile brands I've used earlier.Good:- Android 10! Beautiful looks! Finally I can delete SMS from notification now!!- Display is excellent with Blue light filter.- Performance is good. No heating or lagging. Real Racing worked fine.- 6000 Mah battery is BIG- 128 GB storage is pretty good. 512 GB card supported with dedicated external card slot.- Both dedicated sim slots support LTE- Fast charging and 15W charger top with phone. The phone came with 0% charge. Charged fast.- Mobile speakers sound is good, but I prefer external speakers for better bass in music.- Camera is really good. Macro performance is very good - look at skin in tatoo photo and dust perticles in deskphone photo!! (photos of M31 are from other phone). Both front and rear camera support FHD video 3840x2160. I may not require to carry my DSLR everyehere.- Face unlock / figure-print sensor response is good- Received next day by 11 AM !Not So Good:- Not that thin, but ok.- Doesn't have Samsung Dex- Started to Boot Screen!! Gave me a little shock but selected reboot option and then every thing was smooth. An Android Updated (other than many application updates which is normal in any case) appeared on within days of launch. But update was smooth. No issue at all.- Feels delicate in hand but a Rs.49 cover was good enough. Wrongly ordered black while the set is blue. Just 49 so will reorder the blue one as well :)- Called Samsung Store, but no information with them about availability date. Still no call from them.Feedback- Feels good in hand and in use. It is a powerhouse and you feel it.- Will update after few days of use, but don't have any doubt as of now.Go for it without any doubt.

  Lets just begin with the obvious. This phone's quality doesn't meet the claims made.Cons:1. Camera Quality: Picture quality is just awful. Its worse than a 8MP camera. The pixelization is obvious and it is definitely not a 64MP camera. Do not believe the claims Samsung might make. The quad camera is of no use as the macro camera reminds me of the decade when VGA cameras were common.2. Battery: Samsung may claim the battery will last for two days but it didnt last that long - no Netflix, Prime Video, heavy games being used. So that makes two of the biggest features useless.3. Amazon's Policy: In case you don't like the phone, Amazon has made sure you are stuck with it. The switch from 10 day ""return"" policy to 10 day ""replacement"" policy is dowright wrong! Hold onto the shutters physical mobile stores - your days are not over yet. When you do request for replacement, there is an inspection of the phone at buyer's site - which I understand but the fact that replacement will occur almost on the 10th day from my purchase still keeps me at unease.Pros:1. Display: The screen quality is good and has adjustment options for warm light and cold light.2. Performance: Streaming videos and playing heavy games was smooth for the first 4 days but then again Samsung is known for fast deterioration of performance, so I will keep my eyes and ears open.3. Sound: Speaker quality is okay but not upto the mark. In a noisy place you fail to hear the crispness and the boom.

  I am using it from 3 days , 6000 mah battery is just for name only, it work for 1-1.25 days only with moderate usage.64mp camera doesn't support zoom, camera doesn't support 60fps video recording.Build quality is not good, plastic back with lots of figure prints in few minutes handling, not look new in few seconds.Face unlock very slow.Heat issue which charging and heavy usageFull charge takes more than 3 hrsWould not recommend to buy , if you are looking  for good camera phonego with other brands like oppo or redmi , giving much better quality

  The phone was wrapped in dust. Although it was seal packed, still many dust were on screen and back side. It shows security concerns and Amazon, Samsung and seller must draw its attention. How dust can be reached in seal packed box? Now I'm lacking trust in Amazon,Samsung and seller. Either my phone was used or its components might have replaced, as in brand new phone,there exists no dusts because they are built in factory, but here shows how they are playing with the customer and their product.Phone is nice, large battery backup of more than 2 days, 6.4 display is big, camera is perfect and 6GB ram is enough for daily usage. All things are good. No heating issue.However my only concern is ""dust"" and how it came there if its brand new.So I could give 5 star,but now 1 is enough.Beware of Amazon,Samsung and seller.

  Not a Samsung performance. It seems it was launched without proper test n trials. I already had M30 so decided to buy M31 (6GB). But got shocked to see the poor performance n battery life. The 64MP images can't be sent easily to someone on WhatsApp. Camera give errors now n then. Battery life worst then M30 which has 5000mh. Mobile heats on charging.

  After using for more than 2 day's I must say, snapdragon 730g works wonderful .CAMERA.This time M series did a honest job by giving us a INTELLI camera of 64 mega Pixcel and more feature in selfie camera.DISPLAY & FINGERPRINT.With Samsung SuperAmoled display you can truly trust the amazing view angle. Now in M51 feature of Widevine L Certification you can enjoy all those global Dolby theatre experience. I found it reliable for my 1920p to 4k level of movie watching without any distraction due to Infinite O display which gives Full Screen Ratio. Fingerprint on side is much faster than I expected. It doesn't takes a second also to open. Even FaceUnlock is faster.Superior, as it matches any S series flagship premium in classy look, strong built for this budget amount. 6.7 inches display is good to handle as it is well managed for one hand use also.

  I am giving this review after spending 20 days with this Phone. I am a retail user and after 6 year of redmi and realme user now buy the Samsung just because of Samsung+Snapdragon and very much dispointed. Here are some Pros and Cons which will help other user like me to decide whether they will buy it or not.Cons :1. No Haptic Feedback2. Low sound quality speaker at Rs 25K3. No apps lock features inbuilt4. No Case Cover in Box5. Plain Plastic back design at 25K which attract too much scratches.6. Samsung trusted Knox security not fully enable on this phone i.e no secure folder option.7. When Sealed Package open then phone display contain so much dust. Not expected the packaging like this from brand like Samsung.8. Gorila Glass 3 protection under 25k i.e out dated glass protection after using 2 days with full care i got one scratch mark on display.9. NFC given but Samsung Pay not there in this phone.10. Audio output in my boat rockers bluetooth headset with this phone is not as much as lound as compare to my previous phone Redmi Note 7 pro.11. Without using phone it take 2 hour to charge but when you use it frequently then it take 2.30-3 hour to charged it full from 0-100%.12. Full battery drained in 12 hour with non stop used including youtube, whatsapp Facebook, messaging, etc except game.13. No Carrier aggregation: Using Jio sim in Samsung M51 and realme X2 pro and both contain different net speed in which Samsung giving me 5mbps and realme x2 pro giving me 9-10mbps.14. Calling issue: while talking through ear piece on call, the person can hear my voice clearly. But if i put the call on loudspeaker, the receiver of call cant hear my voice or he hear my sound very low. Turning back to earpiece the person is able to hear me again.15. Camera Zoom quality is not good. When you focus on Sky whole pic turn into blue. i.e saturation level is too much high in this phone (Image attached).16. While watching movie video in this phone or playing video in youtube brightness fluctuate fast too much automatically i.e Adaptive Brightness issue.Pros :1. Super amoled plus display2. Camera quality Good3. 7000 Mah battery4. Till now Ram management is goodTo much hype created every where for this phone and due to this many user like me has purchased this phone but this phone under 25k is really not value for money. I am going to resale this phone. There are so many phone below 25k with best facilities as compare to this Samsung m51.Conclusion : Phone is overpriced and performance is average

  This is a perfect mobile for you,1. If you properly read the spec before buying this mobile2. If you don't expect all iPhone features in this mobile,3. if you are not a addictive gamer,4. If you don't expect your mobile to be a speaker,5. If you do concern about your data handled in Chinese mobiles,6. If you need better SAR value,7.

  It has issue with camera in night mode and pro mode.It seems like there is dust present on camera sensor which is only visible in dark photos. When photo is clicked with lens covered completely,  it shows hundreds of white spots in image, same happens with pro mode too. (This is not regular image noise)

  At first glance it looks a bit bulky. Camera, display etc. are satisfactory. Overall GOOD non Chinese phone.However, for their improvement, I tried to give some critical feedback to the company over phone but it was not so easy, so, I am writing here sothat Samsung India can take this critical review for their improvement.Battery:Battery is 7K mha but it is draining so fast that its overall backup time is slightly better than any other average phone.User Interface:User interface needs tremendous improvement. You can't take screenshot easily. You need to learn fine motor coordination between your fingers and power&volume button with microsecond precision. After three days I discovered taking screenshot by swapping screen. But this easy method for taking screenshot is not easy to find in its setting section. Automatic redial isn't available. also in setting section, searching for basic operation like redial, call waiting etc are either missing or very difficult to access. UI should be more intelligent and intuitive. Call recording should take permission from user before it starts recording any call.Dolby Sound:Dolby sound effect is excellent but its available only for external speaker. Inbuilt speaker don't have Dolby effect. You hv to buy headphone or external speaker for experiencing Dolby sound effect. Its Dolby software is so impressive that its work on a cheapest headphone but Samsung's own inbuilt speaker doesn't.External Outlook:Read somewhere that this phone has 3D prism like glastic body. GLASTIC seems to be a discovery of new material (Glass+Plastic) because its looks transparent and shining. But in reality, its a cheap looking smooth and slippery plastic back body. Also, Its prone to scratches neither its water resistant. Sometimes it generates heat. In this price segment, Samsung can easily provide metallic back for better appearance and transfer of heat.Overall, its good non chini phone with good camera and display, a bit bulky, satisfactory speed, scope of tremendous improvement in UI and setting, and bit overpriced.

  Cons:_OverpricedBattery drain only fast in normal  uses give only  24 hours  backup.Sound quality  is so soBuild quality  is not goodPros:_Good processorGood  cameraUser interface  is goodFinger print sensor  working  very fast but some times missed out.After six days of uses, impressed  with camera performance, Display, fingerprint  working, and processor.Disappointed  with Battery  performance  my brother  realme 2 giving easily 2days battery  backup with 4250mah, but this phone is horrible in battery  backup  only  24 hours  with 7000. I have  doubt  its not 7000 man battery its like 2000 or 2500mah. Heating  issue also faced during  charging.

  Genuine Feedback to samsung and all buyersNot Upto the Mark..Battery is good, but mobile is very heavy.. not handy for one hand operation.. if you use it continuously then you feel pain in your  hand, designed is out dated, poor quality material.. camera is just okay..I am not happy overall performance of this phone at this price band...Mobile should be perfect for 15-16k price band..Lookwise not goodDisplay qaulity is just good not bestSound quality is goodCamera not much good that I am expecting.Big screen which perfect for movie watcher.. but after 30 minutes you feel pain in your hands.I bought Electric blue colour, it's look like samsung old samrt phone .My request to Amazon, is it possible to return this mobile. Then help me for return...I am not happy with overall performance of the phone...

  Ok so here comes the first review of this phone. Ordered on the first day of its sale and received on 3rd day. Indeed its a big and bulky phn but easy to handle. Few highlights:1. Seamless fingerprint scanner. I hv heard tht recent samsung phns have ths issue , however i dnt see any in ths phn. Its as gud as my past phns Asus 6z and Vivo v15pro. Side fingerprint scanner on the power button really makes it stylish and too easy to handle as well.2. Camera quality is really gud wth many features which luks tempting which im yet to explore. Even in dim light it scores quite well. Have all latest features like slow mo, 10x zoom, focus lens, panorma view and other added features.3. Battery ofcourse was the highlight while buying ths phn. I received this phn at 43%. And even after a rigorous 3 hr session of data transfer and apps installation it still holds at 33%. I believe it gonna last 2 days easily wth heavy net usage , mild games and gud 2 hrs of talk time.4. Luks wise it does seem premium despite a plastic back.5. Wonderful touch and a decent processimg speed. I tried playing 7-8 apps at the same time and it never hanged or lagged despite 50% memory up. Yet to try on heavy games though.6. Front cam does spoil the fun while watching full screen videos, like a small black dot bt can be lived wth.7. No headphones in the box.8. C to C charging cable capable of reverse charging too.Overall i wld rate it 4/5. Its one of the best non chinese phn available in the market for those who r luking for a huge battery wth a decent cam and light gaming purpose.Wld update on battery and cam after few days of usage

  There's something wrong with the new Samsung M51 mobile. Many other users are also facing the same issue. We are unable to connect through Wi-Fi on Samsung M51.Meanest Monster Ever ... HahahahaThis meanest monster is performing poorly within 5 min of unboxing. My eight yr old Lenovo still works like charm with Wi-Fi.Issue: When you trying connecting through Wi-Fi, on giving correct password, it says ""Incorrect Password"".I have done every troubleshooting step suggested by Samsung Tech support:1. Forget the connection and reconnect again.2. Update the phone s/w to latest version.3. Reset Settings4. Reset Network Settings5. Factory Data ResetI have applied every step suggested by tech-support and the result is still the same.The most irritating thing is how can a company like Samsung mess-up such a basic feature & to the surprise, even the tech support has now run out of troubleshooting solutions.Instead of replacing it with new phone, tech support has now told me to get the hardware fixed from Samsung Service centre. I don't get it why should I take a brand new phone to service center & get it opened. Instead a replacement of this phone should be there, I have not even used it for more than an hour.Last year I ordered an MI phone from Flipkart, the battery was getting drained very fast. Within the next day, the phone was replaced without questions asked.Dissappointed by Amazon, the way they are handling this issue.Don't spend your hard-earned money on this phone. Unfortunately, if your phone turns-out to be faulty, then there is a never ending process to take care of issue.

  I am writing my review after using it for 6 days.I have bought sumsung phone after 7 years hoping it could be good phone but samsung again disappointed me a lot.They claim it has 6000mAH battery but drain like 3000mAH and it take almost 2.30hrs to charge from 10% to 90% so its fast charging is not a fast charging. Its just a market gimic to clail it monester like features i.e.battery 6000mAH ,15W fast charge ete but reality is far far away from claims.Others features are as per price range but if you thinking for a battery packed phone with fast charge,then I would sugget plz search for others phone in same range.

With 6gb ram,128 GB internal storage and Amoled display I am more than satisfied.I have been using Samsung phones from the start. Samsung's Amoled screen is what I am attracted to the most. The feel it gives is simply amazing.But battery dont seem to be a 6000 mah.As far as a non gamer is concerned this phone is the best under this price range.

  I have been using it for a week.I came back to samsung after using Redmi note and it feels so much better.The touch and feel iss awesome. Fast an smooth operations with anroid 10. Lots of intelligent features at this price like limiting screen time for each app and winddown function in the night etc.. Camera is decent for normal photo. Sound and speakers are good for clear conversations.The only thing which might be a downside for some people'could be compact size of screen especially if you're used to big screens. It might take some time to get accustomed if you are a frequent movie watcher.Overall it's much better than the so called value for money brands like Redmi Oppo Vivo Realme etc which are primarily winning customers by offering more storage battery and big screen but lack performance.A good to buy phone for  9000

  I am writing my review after using it for 6 days.I have bought sumsung phone after 7 years hoping it could be good phone but samsung again disappointed me a lot.They claim it has 6000mAH battery but drain like 3000mAH and it take almost 2.30hrs to charge from 10% to 90% so its fast charging is not a fast charging. Its just a market gimic to clail it monester like features i.e.battery 6000mAH ,15W fast charge ete but reality is far far away from claims.Others features are as per price range but if you thinking for a battery packed phone with fast charge,then I would sugget plz search for others phone in same range.

  Very poor performance. Hangs aloft. Even I don't use any gaming app. In browsing only, this phone lacks. Inspite of having 6 GB RAM. This product serves zero rating. Please don't buy  this. Wastage of money. No refund policy for this device.

  Value for money.I am not a gamer. So can't say about the gaming performance. But for those who are buying it for normal usage, this phone is great. With 6gb ram,128 GB internal storage and Amoled display I am more than satisfied.I have been using Samsung phones from the start. Samsung's Amoled screen is what I am attracted to the most. The feel it gives is simply amazing.But battery dont seem to be a 6000 mah.As far as a non gamer is concerned this phone is the best under this price range.

  Honest review for a Honest Samsung phone. I am writing this review after using M31s for more than half month. And my verdict based on truly improved Samsung M series with my experience & tested after usage only.BUILD QUALITY. Superior, as it matches any S series flagship premium in classy look, strong built for this budget amount. My hand is small but still I found 6.5 inches display is good to handle as it is well managed for one hand use also.DISPLAY & FINGERPRINT.With Samsung SuperAmoled display you can truly trust the amazing view angle. Now in M31s feature of Widevine L Certification you can enjoy all those global Dolby theatre experience. I found it reliable for my 1920p to 4k level of movie watching without any distraction due to Infinite O display which gives Full Screen Ratio. Fingerprint on side is much faster than I expected. It doesn't takes a second also to open. Even FaceUnlock is faster.BATTERY.Main benefit of this midrange M series is it's maasive 6000mAh battery which gave me enough juice for nearly 3 days continuously. Tested.CAMERA.This time M series did a honest job by giving us a INTELLI camera of 64 mwgapixel with Single Take feature. Samsung gives what it advertises. Which made me to stick to Samsung brand. My usage of Camera is high & I found no complaints at all in focusing a shoot. Good color saturated. Well bright night shots. Macro shots r OSM. The depth & clarity of 64 megapixel is more developed in this M31s model. So no complaints.PROCESSOR.After using for more than half month I must say, Exynos 9611 works wonderful liquid speed when it is combined with LPDDR4X RAM technology. I have not faced any lag in PUBG or ASPHALT-9 hight end games, in medium setting which is good for battery saving. So 2.3Ghz speed accomplished. No complaints for the budget spent.SOUND QUALITY.After using for hours I found the Speaker this time Samsung made is much improved with Bass Stereo which was missing earlier. The in-ear delivers your ear the pure Dolby Atmos with clear precision and crystal clear bass effect.Bang for the bucks go for it. Thanks Amazon for Safe delivery.

  Ordered on Prime day, 6th August 12 AM. Received the phone on 8th August.All aspects of the phone is on par or above the next segment.Display is gorgeous.Lookwise it doesn't feel like an M series phone.FP sensor works well although it can store only 3 fingerprints.Camera is overall good. Can't say it's a camera centric phone obviously. However it has some good outputs6000mah battery with 25W fast charging is awesome. (you get reverse charging as well).The only con i felt till now is the exclusion of a phone cover in the box. This might sound silly but I'm one of those guy's who use phone with a cover only to be on the safer side. Just because there is no cover I'm unable to use the phone as my daily driver right now.Come on Samsung. How much will a tpu cover cost for you?? 50Rs??M31s is actually A51 without on screen fp. It has better specs than A51 which retails around 8-9k than M31s which makes this phone one of a kind.The dimensions are also the same as A51. So you can use the same tempered glass but cant use A51 back cover for M31s since it should have the cutout for side mounted fp scanner.Overall a great phone. Value for money I should say. If you are not a heavy gamer this is the best choice around.Will update the review after using the phone for 2 weeks.Till then book your phone and wait for the delivery as it is back-ordered at this moment.

  Strongly recommend No..why samsung make lot advertise on m31s.really don't know wt makes new compared to other M series. 'Single take' shot option really useless.People who r looking for camera please don't buy m31s.All the modes camers pictures are 95%blur mode.perfomance of mobile is not up to expectations.When turns into selife mode really shocked IS IT HD photo or Asian paints colored WALL.REALLY SHOCKED.THIS TIME SAMSUNG DISAPPOINTED.Videos display is also not so effective. Starting of series most of them said not  a gaming mobile.really its not gaming mobile.No samsung pay Nfc,No backcase,l.Rather than spending 20k on m31s supposed to switch another model.Name it as blur mobile.THANKS

  Initial impression after using for one day.1. The display is Gorgeous. Feels like a high end device2. Specs say 6000 MaH battery. Power management is not up to the mark. Without using any power intensive app battery drain is quite pronounced and noticeable.  Hopefully Samsung will release a patch to fix this3.Camera: Impressive.  Good lighting conditions result in beautiful and detailed shots. Struggles a bit during the low light conditions. Overall quite ok for the price.4. Processor: Not the fastest out there  but does the job. Nothing to complain about5. Fingerprint scanner is decent.6. No back case in the box. Will take time to get new case delivered.  Case is necessary as the back panel is quite slippery7. I believe the cost should have around 17K instead of 19.5k...! But if you want a non Chinese phone then this is a good option to consider

  I am using this for last 2-3 days now.This is my review after actually using this pgone in all aspects.Pros -1. Canera - Excellent camera - Good low light photography.  64 Megapixel does uts wor. Inteli Cam is just awesome.2. Display is just Superfine even in direct sunlight it works Excellent.Touch is just Excellent.3. Phone looks really cool in hands.4. Smart pop up feature is also good to have.5. UI is good.6. Speaker sound is good.7. No issues in calls - No call drips using Airtel sim.Overall its very nice experience using this phone.I researched alot before burying this phone and i am happy that i made this choice.Cons -1. Battery doesn't look like 6000 MAH it typically gives 1.5 days backup with single charge which other phone alao gives with relatively less Mah Battery.I was hoping to get little more backup2. Processor  - Could have been better3  No back cover for phone as it is hard to find in a market

  An excellent device would not be an enough word to describe this phone.Got it through prime and Amazon delivered it before time once again delighted with wonderful service by Amazon and the device is a masterpiece.Loaded with awesome features like 1 click camera, 6000mah battery, reverse charging, bigger and butter smooth super amoled display.Samsung has started to capture the Indian market and that ultimately allow us as customers to get rid of data stealer and spy Chinese phones.You can definitely go for this phone blindly

  Hi all,From Samsung M31s.Bought it on Amazon Prime day sale. Placed the order by 00:04 of 6th August (Day-1 of the sale) and got it very next day Noon 2pm itself. Kudos Amazon India.Grabbed it for 15,999 with a 2k coupon code and HDFC's 10% discount.But, ordered a Matte Back cover and Matte Temper glass (As it didn't come with the box and also wasn't available near me in Chennai). Delivery date is 18th to 25th Aug which is pathetic. I have to take care my SaM31s like a baby.Small review as per my knowledge -On-hand, its so good. (Earlier was using OnePlus 6) Size wise bit bigger that 1+6 (6.5"")Comparing to Nord, we have Memory card slot - no dependency.While updating the phone on first start, i felt bit heat. But later, it was fine.Charged a 100% and had an extensive usage (not a gamer). Battery lasts more than 36hrs (with Bluetooth earphone at times).Charging happened in 70-75 mins with intermediate usage in between.Earphone Jack available comparing to Nord, better than Bluetooth earphone which consumes charge and needs charge for earphones too.Settings - an ocean of settings, wonderful touch sensor and additional features for lock facilities.But, doesn't have indicator on the front face (which shows if notifications are received)No option to find app usage statistics.Audio - Its so good with clear audio in all needs.Photo - Video : Excellent quality of photos and Videos even in a 3x Zoom. Front camera is bit down.Macro Mode is giving a great pic of Close shots.Has Slowmo, Super slowmo, Hyperlapse, Panaroma.AR zone is pure magical. Different features for Front cam and Back cam.Reverse charging facility is amazing. But the box doesn't have USB - charge cable.Overall - M31s is a price worthy with sooo many options.EDIT : Corning Gorilla Glass 3 is fine,just on 10th day of my purchase, my phone fallen down with less than 1m height (slipped from hand) and display borken 💔Handle with care.

  This is best thing you can get at this price from a reputed brand with Made in India tag. First time I ordered on the first day of online launch and am happy. I'm writing after few days of usage, but this should not be different as my experience with Samsung has been most consistent as compared to other mobile brands I've used earlier.Good:- Android 10! Beautiful looks! Finally I can delete SMS from notification now!!- Display is excellent with Blue light filter.- Performance is good. No heating or lagging. Real Racing worked fine.- 6000 Mah battery is BIG- 128 GB storage is pretty good. 512 GB card supported with dedicated external card slot.- Both dedicated sim slots support LTE- Fast charging and 15W charger top with phone. The phone came with 0% charge. Charged fast.- Mobile speakers sound is good, but I prefer external speakers for better bass in music.- Camera is really good. Macro performance is very good - look at skin in tatoo photo and dust perticles in deskphone photo!! (photos of M31 are from other phone). Both front and rear camera support FHD video 3840x2160. I may not require to carry my DSLR everyehere.- Face unlock / figure-print sensor response is good- Received next day by 11 AM !Not So Good:- Not that thin, but ok.- Doesn't have Samsung Dex- Started to Boot Screen!! Gave me a little shock but selected reboot option and then every thing was smooth. An Android Updated (other than many application updates which is normal in any case) appeared on within days of launch. But update was smooth. No issue at all.- Feels delicate in hand but a Rs.49 cover was good enough. Wrongly ordered black while the set is blue. Just 49 so will reorder the blue one as well :)- Called Samsung Store, but no information with them about availability date. Still no call from them.Feedback- Feels good in hand and in use. It is a powerhouse and you feel it.- Will update after few days of use, but don't have any doubt as of now.Go for it without any doubt.

  Lets just begin with the obvious. This phone's quality doesn't meet the claims made.Cons:1. Camera Quality: Picture quality is just awful. Its worse than a 8MP camera. The pixelization is obvious and it is definitely not a 64MP camera. Do not believe the claims Samsung might make. The quad camera is of no use as the macro camera reminds me of the decade when VGA cameras were common.2. Battery: Samsung may claim the battery will last for two days but it didnt last that long - no Netflix, Prime Video, heavy games being used. So that makes two of the biggest features useless.3. Amazon's Policy: In case you don't like the phone, Amazon has made sure you are stuck with it. The switch from 10 day ""return"" policy to 10 day ""replacement"" policy is dowright wrong! Hold onto the shutters physical mobile stores - your days are not over yet. When you do request for replacement, there is an inspection of the phone at buyer's site - which I understand but the fact that replacement will occur almost on the 10th day from my purchase still keeps me at unease.Pros:1. Display: The screen quality is good and has adjustment options for warm light and cold light.2. Performance: Streaming videos and playing heavy games was smooth for the first 4 days but then again Samsung is known for fast deterioration of performance, so I will keep my eyes and ears open.3. Sound: Speaker quality is okay but not upto the mark. In a noisy place you fail to hear the crispness and the boom.

Beautiful looks! Finally I can delete SMS from notification now!!- Display is excellent with Blue light filter.- Performance is good. No heating or lagging. Real Racing worked fine.- 6000 Mah battery is BIG- 128 GB storage is pretty good. 512 GB card supported with dedicated external card slot.- Both dedicated sim slots support LTE- Fast charging and 15W charger top with phone. The phone came with 0% charge. Charged fast.- Mobile speakers sound is good, but I prefer external speakers for better bass in music.- Camera is really good. Macro performance is very good - look at skin in tatoo photo and dust perticles in deskphone photo!! (photos of M31 are from other phone). Both front and rear camera support FHD video 3840x2160. I may not require to carry my DSLR everyehere.- Face unlock / figure-print sensor response is good- Received next day by 11 AM !Not So Good:- Not that thin, but ok.- Doesn't have Samsung Dex- Started to Boot Screen!! Gave me a little shock but selected reboot option and then every thing was smooth. An Android Updated (other than many application updates which is normal in any case) appeared on within days of launch. But update was smooth. No issue at all.- Feels delicate in hand but a Rs.49 cover was good enough. Wrongly ordered black while the set is blue. Just 49 so will reorder the blue one as well :)- Called Samsung Store, but no information with them about availability date. Still no call from them.Feedback- Feels good in hand and in use. It is a powerhouse and you feel it.- Will update after few days of use, but don't have any doubt as of now.Go for it without any doubt.

  Lets just begin with the obvious. This phone's quality doesn't meet the claims made.Cons:1. Camera Quality: Picture quality is just awful. Its worse than a 8MP camera. The pixelization is obvious and it is definitely not a 64MP camera. Do not believe the claims Samsung might make. The quad camera is of no use as the macro camera reminds me of the decade when VGA cameras were common.2. Battery: Samsung may claim the battery will last for two days but it didnt last that long - no Netflix, Prime Video, heavy games being used. So that makes two of the biggest features useless.3. Amazon's Policy: In case you don't like the phone, Amazon has made sure you are stuck with it. The switch from 10 day ""return"" policy to 10 day ""replacement"" policy is dowright wrong! Hold onto the shutters physical mobile stores - your days are not over yet. When you do request for replacement, there is an inspection of the phone at buyer's site - which I understand but the fact that replacement will occur almost on the 10th day from my purchase still keeps me at unease.Pros:1. Display: The screen quality is good and has adjustment options for warm light and cold light.2. Performance: Streaming videos and playing heavy games was smooth for the first 4 days but then again Samsung is known for fast deterioration of performance, so I will keep my eyes and ears open.3. Sound: Speaker quality is okay but not upto the mark. In a noisy place you fail to hear the crispness and the boom.

  I am using it from 3 days , 6000 mah battery is just for name only, it work for 1-1.25 days only with moderate usage.64mp camera doesn't support zoom, camera doesn't support 60fps video recording.Build quality is not good, plastic back with lots of figure prints in few minutes handling, not look new in few seconds.Face unlock very slow.Heat issue which charging and heavy usageFull charge takes more than 3 hrsWould not recommend to buy , if you are looking  for good camera phonego with other brands like oppo or redmi , giving much better quality

  The phone was wrapped in dust. Although it was seal packed, still many dust were on screen and back side. It shows security concerns and Amazon, Samsung and seller must draw its attention. How dust can be reached in seal packed box? Now I'm lacking trust in Amazon,Samsung and seller. Either my phone was used or its components might have replaced, as in brand new phone,there exists no dusts because they are built in factory, but here shows how they are playing with the customer and their product.Phone is nice, large battery backup of more than 2 days, 6.4 display is big, camera is perfect and 6GB ram is enough for daily usage. All things are good. No heating issue.However my only concern is ""dust"" and how it came there if its brand new.So I could give 5 star,but now 1 is enough.Beware of Amazon,Samsung and seller.

  Not a Samsung performance. It seems it was launched without proper test n trials. I already had M30 so decided to buy M31 (6GB). But got shocked to see the poor performance n battery life. The 64MP images can't be sent easily to someone on WhatsApp. Camera give errors now n then. Battery life worst then M30 which has 5000mh. Mobile heats on charging.

  Honest review for a Honest Samsung phone. I am writing this review after using M31s for more than half month. And my verdict based on truly improved Samsung M series with my experience & tested after usage only.BUILD QUALITY. Superior, as it matches any S series flagship premium in classy look, strong built for this budget amount. My hand is small but still I found 6.5 inches display is good to handle as it is well managed for one hand use also.DISPLAY & FINGERPRINT.With Samsung SuperAmoled display you can truly trust the amazing view angle. Now in M31s feature of Widevine L Certification you can enjoy all those global Dolby theatre experience. I found it reliable for my 1920p to 4k level of movie watching without any distraction due to Infinite O display which gives Full Screen Ratio. Fingerprint on side is much faster than I expected. It doesn't takes a second also to open. Even FaceUnlock is faster.BATTERY.Main benefit of this midrange M series is it's maasive 6000mAh battery which gave me enough juice for nearly 3 days continuously. Tested.CAMERA.This time M series did a honest job by giving us a INTELLI camera of 64 mwgapixel with Single Take feature. Samsung gives what it advertises. Which made me to stick to Samsung brand. My usage of Camera is high & I found no complaints at all in focusing a shoot. Good color saturated. Well bright night shots. Macro shots r OSM. The depth & clarity of 64 megapixel is more developed in this M31s model. So no complaints.PROCESSOR.After using for more than half month I must say, Exynos 9611 works wonderful liquid speed when it is combined with LPDDR4X RAM technology. I have not faced any lag in PUBG or ASPHALT-9 hight end games, in medium setting which is good for battery saving. So 2.3Ghz speed accomplished. No complaints for the budget spent.SOUND QUALITY.After using for hours I found the Speaker this time Samsung made is much improved with Bass Stereo which was missing earlier. The in-ear delivers your ear the pure Dolby Atmos with clear precision and crystal clear bass effect.Bang for the bucks go for it. Thanks Amazon for Safe delivery.

  Ordered on Prime day, 6th August 12 AM. Received the phone on 8th August.All aspects of the phone is on par or above the next segment.Display is gorgeous.Lookwise it doesn't feel like an M series phone.FP sensor works well although it can store only 3 fingerprints.Camera is overall good. Can't say it's a camera centric phone obviously. However it has some good outputs6000mah battery with 25W fast charging is awesome. (you get reverse charging as well).The only con i felt till now is the exclusion of a phone cover in the box. This might sound silly but I'm one of those guy's who use phone with a cover only to be on the safer side. Just because there is no cover I'm unable to use the phone as my daily driver right now.Come on Samsung. How much will a tpu cover cost for you?? 50Rs??M31s is actually A51 without on screen fp. It has better specs than A51 which retails around 8-9k than M31s which makes this phone one of a kind.The dimensions are also the same as A51. So you can use the same tempered glass but cant use A51 back cover for M31s since it should have the cutout for side mounted fp scanner.Overall a great phone. Value for money I should say. If you are not a heavy gamer this is the best choice around.Will update the review after using the phone for 2 weeks.Till then book your phone and wait for the delivery as it is back-ordered at this moment.

Starting of series most of them said not  a gaming mobile.really its not gaming mobile.No samsung pay Nfc,No backcase,l.Rather than spending 20k on m31s supposed to switch another model.Name it as blur mobile.THANKS

  Initial impression after using for one day.1. The display is Gorgeous. Feels like a high end device2. Specs say 6000 MaH battery. Power management is not up to the mark. Without using any power intensive app battery drain is quite pronounced and noticeable.  Hopefully Samsung will release a patch to fix this3.Camera: Impressive.  Good lighting conditions result in beautiful and detailed shots. Struggles a bit during the low light conditions. Overall quite ok for the price.4. Processor: Not the fastest out there  but does the job. Nothing to complain about5. Fingerprint scanner is decent.6. No back case in the box. Will take time to get new case delivered.  Case is necessary as the back panel is quite slippery7. I believe the cost should have around 17K instead of 19.5k...! But if you want a non Chinese phone then this is a good option to consider

  I am using this for last 2-3 days now.This is my review after actually using this pgone in all aspects.Pros -1. Canera - Excellent camera - Good low light photography.  64 Megapixel does uts wor. Inteli Cam is just awesome.2. Display is just Superfine even in direct sunlight it works Excellent.Touch is just Excellent.3. Phone looks really cool in hands.4. Smart pop up feature is also good to have.5. UI is good.6. Speaker sound is good.7. No issues in calls - No call drips using Airtel sim.Overall its very nice experience using this phone.I researched alot before burying this phone and i am happy that i made this choice.Cons -1. Battery doesn't look like 6000 MAH it typically gives 1.5 days backup with single charge which other phone alao gives with relatively less Mah Battery.I was hoping to get little more backup2. Processor  - Could have been better3  No back cover for phone as it is hard to find in a market

  Hi all,From Samsung M31s.Bought it on Amazon Prime day sale. Placed the order by 00:04 of 6th August (Day-1 of the sale) and got it very next day Noon 2pm itself. Kudos Amazon India.Grabbed it for 15,999 with a 2k coupon code and HDFC's 10% discount.But, ordered a Matte Back cover and Matte Temper glass (As it didn't come with the box and also wasn't available near me in Chennai). Delivery date is 18th to 25th Aug which is pathetic. I have to take care my SaM31s like a baby.Small review as per my knowledge -On-hand, its so good. (Earlier was using OnePlus 6) Size wise bit bigger that 1+6 (6.5"")Comparing to Nord, we have Memory card slot - no dependency.While updating the phone on first start, i felt bit heat. But later, it was fine.Charged a 100% and had an extensive usage (not a gamer). Battery lasts more than 36hrs (with Bluetooth earphone at times).Charging happened in 70-75 mins with intermediate usage in between.Earphone Jack available comparing to Nord, better than Bluetooth earphone which consumes charge and needs charge for earphones too.Settings - an ocean of settings, wonderful touch sensor and additional features for lock facilities.But, doesn't have indicator on the front face (which shows if notifications are received)No option to find app usage statistics.Audio - Its so good with clear audio in all needs.Photo - Video : Excellent quality of photos and Videos even in a 3x Zoom. Front camera is bit down.Macro Mode is giving a great pic of Close shots.Has Slowmo, Super slowmo, Hyperlapse, Panaroma.AR zone is pure magical. Different features for Front cam and Back cam.Reverse charging facility is amazing. But the box doesn't have USB - charge cable.Overall - M31s is a price worthy with sooo many options.EDIT : Corning Gorilla Glass 3 is fine,just on 10th day of my purchase, my phone fallen down with less than 1m height (slipped from hand) and display borken 💔Handle with care.

Supports OTG as well.Cons1. Camera below average still expected but samsung should work more on this front if they wanna beat chinese phones.2.Not for gamers and thats expected buy a 4gb Ram 🤔 based phone why reading me?😉3.finger print and face lock missing I Can manage but most indians can't.4.Battery takes 3.15 hours to charge to work for 12 hours of calling and surfing and thats not bad at all but can be issue for chinese phone lovers who have habit of charging again and again to play pubg.Overall out of 5.Camera-2  Gui-4  Screen ppi-5  speed-4  android-4Don't buy a phone only because of specifications must see integration and longevity overall a nice secondary option and primary for featured phone switchers.

  After using 4/5 days suddenly without notice, the phone shutdown automatically and I couldn't restart it. So contact with amazon for replacing it and get very quick response from their end and they book a time slot to verify it by a technician. But after few hours later I found in start up guide send by Samsung,  how to restart when it stops working or hanged( by pressing power and volume key simultaneously for seven seconds or more). The fault is from the end of Samsung company I suppose, because they should mention the process on the front page with bold letter. Most of the reviews which get 1 star facing the same problems like of mine.  After using one month I want to add some extra points which impressed me.1. Sound quality and graphics are very good.2. Smooth touch sensitivity3. Ringtones are much louder.4.Two volte nano SIM s work fine together.5.Battery backup is good. Charging time is not so lengthy.6.Any SIM can be switched off manually, that impressed me.7. 2GB ram and 32 GB storage is better option for budget friendly people.8. I faced hanging problem for one day only till now , which can be easily solved by pressing volume down key and power key simultaneously for 7 seconds or more.8. Lastly this mobile is Made in India which I like the most.  So any one can go for it. Amazon agents are really helpful which I experienced.

  I am writing this review after the usage of 15 days. It is one of the worst phones Samsung has made with multiple issues. Me and my friend both purchased the same phone for our aunts and are facing the same issues. The main issue I am facing is that the phone switched off 2 days back and since then I am trying to switch it on but its leading me nowhere. Neither it is charging. Phone heats up while charging as well as in normal usage conditions. While charging the phone heats up to an extent that one may feel that it could blast. My friend also faced the phone off issue but it was resolved automatically after 2 days when he connected a fast carger to the phone. He is too facing the heating issue. His phone still switches off on its own again and again now and then... All we both are able to do is to regret on wastage of our money.

  I have recieved this phone on 14th of August 2020 and today is 24th of August 2020.So After 10 Days i am reviewing this phone because i have seen many negative reviews on amazon review portal so now my true experience is about this phone following.1:- Processor Media tek Quad core Is best because quad core take less power from battry than the octa core processor. and i purchased this phone for my mom so quad core porcessor is sufficient to my mom.2:- Battry life is good because of Quad Core Processor.3:- Ram is 2Gb that is also sufficient4:- Display as always awesome as samsung provide.5:- Mike and Speaker's quality is too good as always samsung provide.6:- Many People said in the review that the mobile is automatically swiched off and on automatically. yes i have seen this my own only one time. but its not the problem. every new phone have done this one time because of system works smoothly. and after one time switch off on things happen then never repeated till my 10 days of use this phone. so you people who is taking switch off on problem very seriously ,you should not. this is one time process when phone is new sometimes phone may swich off and on automatically. so dont panik at all for this.7:- most of the people want to replace the phone because of one time switch off on problem then i have to say one thing that your first phone is the only phone who is brand new and the replaced phone never be a new phone at all . so never replace your new phone. this is my own experience.8:- I am fully satisfied from this phone in this price of 6499.9:-This is all the reason that is why i am giving 5 star this phone.Thank U Samsung.

  Pros:1) Clean and bloatfree OxygenOS, which runs as smooth as they come.2) AMOLED screen and 90Hz refresh rate really go along to make the display above average.3) Battery life is decent and will last a day on normal usage.4) Sound quality is good and modestly loud. (Drawback in Cons)5) The design actually fits the hand well as it is shorter than usual on breadth, and a bit more on length, all the more better viewing experience.6) Gaming performance is average. (Similar phones in this range have better gaming performances)7) The phone looks and feels premium while using.8) The alert slider makes it very convenient to switch between different modes.9) Face Unlock is as fast as other OnePlus phones. (Very very fast)Cons:1) The camera is not as good as it was expected. The macro lens is pretty useless, and the main camera lacks depth and the colors aren't as vibrant as OnePlus 8. A bit too much of beautification was there in selfie shots. 4K video recording @ 60fps is absent but 1080@60fps performance is quite good. (The camera is better than most phones out there but it isn't what we were promised)2) No headphone jack.3) The mono speaker is on the bottom right of the phone, which tends to get covered by your hand while using. Also, being on just one side of the phone, the audio isn't as well delivered as it is on a stereo speaker.4) No expandable memory slot.5) The plastic frame (doesn't look like plastic but it is) is a worrying thing and makes the phone *comparatively* less durable.6) Fingerprint scanner being under the screen isn't as quick as a traditional fingerprint scanner on the back.Recommendation: If you're looking for a phone which delivers high performance and smooth interface for your daily use, go for it.But if your prime purpose is gaming, there are better options available.Also, if you're expecting flagship camera performance, you might want to consider other phones. (Pixel 4a is about to release, that's far better probably)Update: Pixel 4a camera is surely much better that Nord's camera.

  It's not very often I leave a critical review for any product. But i was so excited when my new OnePlus Nord got delivered to me earlier today, ahead of time. While i am still exploring the phone, the one aspect that is a complete let down is the camera. The pics I clicked were grainy and so not cool. I must say oneplus, you guys really turned me off this time, like honestly. Most phones these days look and feel alike with the camera being one aspect that sets the winners apart from ordinary phones...i dont know what you guys did here. Not expected team OnePlus...this is just not you. My Poco F1 that i purchased 2 years back returned 10 times better pics.

  Battery usage update: Drains faster than other one plus models...so for the ones travelling frequently, this might not be an ideal phone...fast charging is a relief for ones who have access to charging point....Morning to Night usage possible with moderate to slightly heavy usage....Bottomline: A good entry phone for those who have never experienced One Plus and the ones with budget constraints... For others, one plus 8T(lighter than pro model at 180 gms) would be ideal which should bring 120Hz refresh rate and maybe wireless charging too..And for those who can afford and dont mind a heavy phone(200+ gms), One plus 8 pro or 8T Pro would be ideal ones.(As per Amazon reviews some users are reporting display issues with 8 pro, so 8T Pro hopefully will be a better model.) I still use 7T pro which provides the best of One Plus experience...INITIAL IMPRESSIONS:No tint issue which has been widely reported.Smooth given 12gb RAM and 90Hz refresh rate.Lighter than Pro Model but still feels sturdy.Camera quality on par with top model one plus devices in case of outdoor pictures, Indoor/low light pictures are not that good...Not a fan of punch hole cameras..would have preferred full screen with pop up instead.Battery usage - needs to be tested but seems to be ok....

  Yea..pre-ordered on 28 July, got it on 4 August. Package was nice without any damage. So here is my first impression:• Display is so nice and 90 hz refresh rate feels so nice and smooth.•Camera is okay, but not upto the mark..macro lens and depth sensor at the back is just crap. Wide angle is okay, but images are too smooth without any crispness.•60 fps video recording at 4K is not there at rear cam, but is present for front cam. Don't know why they did that😅•Premium user-experience.•face unlock and in-display fingerprint is good.•Phone lacks a true premium feel due to the plastic frame.•The signature slide button delivers the same good experience.Okay, so if you feel that you need a 5G chipset and be future-proof, definitely go for it. If you want a flagship perfomance, go for K20 pro or OnePlus 7T as this wont be a good choice for heavy users, but still a good experience in regards of games for a short-run(COD in high graphics and frame rate ran smooth without any sudden frame drops, because it got an overclocked GPU). StillI am satisfied with what I got here✌️*UPDATED*•Excellent charging speed(Thanks to Warp charge, 10 to 100 in less than an hour)•Battery backup is so good for daily users. Lasts almost a day.•No serious heating issues at all.•This is a mid-range phone(one of the best) and should not expect a monster perfomance from it.•One of the best choice as a daily-driver( If heavy perfomance is not your priority)

  Heavily disappointed. So much of hype and the camera is not even upto the mark. Grainy pictures, looks like I have applied some kind of filter for my selfies. There is no way to undo it. The haptic feedback is good. However, there are several bugs on this phone. Hoping that they will get it fixed with an update! Also don’t panic and nitpick with screen quality! Looks great to me!But don’t  fall for the marketing gimmick. OnePlus promised something extraordinary and they have failed. Also, there were several troubles while registering my phone for the Red Cable Club. But several attempts and a complaint with the customer care, it was solved.

  I bought this phone for augmented reality purpose. They even launched it with the caption ""World First AR launching"". But this Nord is not supporting Augmented reality. I am damn fooled by One plus. Totally disappointed for my long wait. 500 rupees is wasted for prelaunch.AR is must and should technology in 2020phones. Even 10K phones are giving better support.Why One plus released a skull without brain. So I return this worthless (for me). Waste of time.

Wash it before using it on your phone.Camera could've been a little better.The touch is not as smooth as the other one plus phones.Fast as hell.Colors are very vibrant.Does not have a notification LED. or a earphone jack.The grey is very attractive.

I was also excited about this product like everyone else because I was going with the one plus brand. But if u r investing 28k for a mobile then it should satisfy your basic average needs at least. The camera quality is below average. 1 rating giving only for this. Otherwise features are good.

  Pros:1) Clean and bloatfree OxygenOS, which runs as smooth as they come.2) AMOLED screen and 90Hz refresh rate really go along to make the display above average.3) Battery life is decent and will last a day on normal usage.4) Sound quality is good and modestly loud. (Drawback in Cons)5) The design actually fits the hand well as it is shorter than usual on breadth, and a bit more on length, all the more better viewing experience.6) Gaming performance is average. (Similar phones in this range have better gaming performances)7) The phone looks and feels premium while using.8) The alert slider makes it very convenient to switch between different modes.9) Face Unlock is as fast as other OnePlus phones. (Very very fast)Cons:1) The camera is not as good as it was expected. The macro lens is pretty useless, and the main camera lacks depth and the colors aren't as vibrant as OnePlus 8. A bit too much of beautification was there in selfie shots. 4K video recording @ 60fps is absent but 1080@60fps performance is quite good. (The camera is better than most phones out there but it isn't what we were promised)2) No headphone jack.3) The mono speaker is on the bottom right of the phone, which tends to get covered by your hand while using. Also, being on just one side of the phone, the audio isn't as well delivered as it is on a stereo speaker.4) No expandable memory slot.5) The plastic frame (doesn't look like plastic but it is) is a worrying thing and makes the phone *comparatively* less durable.6) Fingerprint scanner being under the screen isn't as quick as a traditional fingerprint scanner on the back.Recommendation: If you're looking for a phone which delivers high performance and smooth interface for your daily use, go for it.But if your prime purpose is gaming, there are better options available.Also, if you're expecting flagship camera performance, you might want to consider other phones. (Pixel 4a is about to release, that's far better probably)Update: Pixel 4a camera is surely much better that Nord's camera.

  It's not very often I leave a critical review for any product. But i was so excited when my new OnePlus Nord got delivered to me earlier today, ahead of time. While i am still exploring the phone, the one aspect that is a complete let down is the camera. The pics I clicked were grainy and so not cool. I must say oneplus, you guys really turned me off this time, like honestly. Most phones these days look and feel alike with the camera being one aspect that sets the winners apart from ordinary phones...i dont know what you guys did here. Not expected team OnePlus...this is just not you. My Poco F1 that i purchased 2 years back returned 10 times better pics. Since i cant return this item, I'm going to live with this for a while before i upgrade. I am sorry for the negative review.

  For 25K , you will get- Average performance. Already Chrome hanged couple of times.- Single Mono Speaker, which gets blocked since it is downward facing. Sound quality is not good- Good Camera but it should improve with sw update, since hw is capable.- Below Average Battery. Reducing to 60Hz refresh rate would help.- Good Build Quality .- in-screen Finger print sensor is OK-OK.- Useless 5G- No battery indication or notification led when screen is off. You have to tap button to see these on screen.  I am fan of stock android feel , one of the reason to buy this phone . I am not a gamer. I was using One Plus 5T ,5T is giving similar performance. Hence if you are using 5T or later and you are looking to update then don't think about it.  Removing unused Apps is important to save memory since this model is 6GB/64GB.  5G is useless which you are paying for. Irony is by the time 5G comes , this phone will be become slower and battery issue will be more prominent . My last hope is on software updates. You can save money by buying phone less than 20K which will give similar performance. One plus forgot what they were best at. Now they are trying to bring flagship product with flagship price like oneplus 7/8 . One plus brought Nord to bring their original customers back but Nord does not live upto expectations. It is half hearted attempt by one plus to make Nord as flagship killer.But it has failed since one plus are making their own oneplus7/8 series flagship phones which they do not want to kill. At this price( 25K +2k for BT headphones), this phone is neither a good budget phone nor flagship killer.

  The phone is really great performance wise, the screen pixels are amazing. But I'm not much satisfied with the storage. I recently purchased it in 6GB+64GB, and the system storage is 20 GB one which I can't do anything. If 20 GB is what you are giving and 64 GB I'm buying all I'm left with is 44 GB. And after installing few apps it's almost 35-40 GB. So what is the point of buying a phone with such less storage space.

  I have been using it since 14-15 days. So here is a short term review of the phone.Display: Fantastic, fluidic display. Didn't face any tint issue.Battery: Getting 8-9 hrs of SOT even with 1-1.5 hr of casual gaming.Performance: 90 Hz ref rate makes app opening, scrolling super smooth. No lag faced during gaming, scrolling through social media.Camera: I don't use the camera much so can't comment about this aspect.Few cons I have come across are :1) A bit slow fingerprint scanner.2) Slight heating during charging and extended gaming periods.3) Didn't find appropriate customisation options for font.

  Regarding the one plus feeling. It's gone..See how they sell their 6 gb 64 varient through flash sales. Yy the blue varient is not yet available for sale in base varient after 2 Months.1.5 month waiting for buying base varient.. Geat!Just one answer they are trying to make every bit more by selling higher varient. Forcefully making people to buy their higher varient even when selling point advertised is still 25k.I own a one plus 5 and I was still impressed with that phone in every aspect camera & performance.Regarding the nord. The front camera is just waste. Not even half the quality when compared to 3 year old oneplus 5..great oneplus..Their was a feeling of giving the most with every penny spend from oneplus till now.. It's gone and never gonna get that trust back from people oneplus.Writing on - how long waiting for a phone and the struggle to get a phone one flash sale + phone issues.1+.. It would be better to look back how oneplus earned this place. And loosing the current stand doesn't need any other reasons.

  Everything is fine, 765G is really good for battery. the one thing that annoys me is 64 gb is way too low storage, where 20 used by system itself and then welcome to bloatware ..u can't delete apps like Netflix and fb or some of google app which is really useless. I barely use Netflix on phone. after all that u get only 35 gb of use. There is also some technical glitch regarding to onePlus's  so called 50 gb cloud storage, I m still unable to get this benefit including device protection through oneplus care.Camera is superb as expected. display is in the top notch. charging is awesome i.e. really fast.

  I changed OnePlus 8, 4 times! Due to something or the other defects (like headache giving screens, line marks at the back of the body, etc) as it's expensive!Phone boxes were puffed, torned, some displays were dull if noticed closely, more warm and yellowish. No control by OnePlus on this. People go nuts like ""wow what a display"" not realizing that they are being given inferior quality displays of Samsung.I hope I really hope people strive for perfection to really understand and get what they are paying for by controlling their excitements a bit and forward stronger feedbacks, as I believe I was listened and Amazon India did helped me too.My 5th device came altogether from a different location, excellent box, phone built and display feels more broader even with same dimensions, no two parallel lines design or defect at the back, it's clean and curvy like OnePlus 8 8gb variant (mine is the 6gb one). Screen display is still more warm which I didn't want but colors are very punchy and clearly shows the display is far better than previous returned devices.1st OnePlus 8 8gb - Had a very long permanent line mark at the back of the body if looked closely.2nd OnePlus 8 8gb - Display's blue light filter had issues I'm sure as it gave me headache in seconds, eye strain as well.3rd OnePlus 8 6gb - 2 parallel lines on edges of the back body if the device was tilted a little, was like a dent kind of design or defect (I believe though this one had the best display even than the 5th one that I'm keeping and more smoother 90 HZ).4th OnePlus 8 6gb - 2 parallel lines were again there so I thought it's normal and was okay with it, but display was yellowish and dull, playing pubg with graphics optimization made the game look more ugly in extreme hd settings (hdr sucks). Looking at Images on articles, etc were looking just good.5th OnePlus 8 6gb variant - As told above there are no 2 parallel lines, punchy colors, not dull and very good display, however still yellowish in large part of the screen and whitish around above and right & left edges of the screen in vivid mode (I did noticed in some displays it was not this warm). I also noticed vivid mode was nicer and whiter in previous devices than this one whether they were dull or not.I also know screen being yellowish a bit makes video viewing an amazing experience to make it more natural for skin color, etc. But should be less and corrected with all the flaws mentioned. However, I'm tierd and somewhat satisfied but will want OnePlus to correct if possible with software update without compromising any quality of the display.It's said that Apple never compromises on quality, they even delay their production if they find any imperfections (I don't like iOS or use Apple though).  OnePlus should do like this.Not happy at all with this kind of support. I noticed paying more (when I got the 8gb one) was really like getting better qalutiy made device (the first one, if the issue mentioned wasn't there). This shouldn't be the case as this leads to disappointment and all variants should be given the same attention/perfection with just internal hardware changes.OnePlus 8 will be my first and last device for a short period of time. Will look for a brand who cares. 3 out of 5.

  Great phone!Gaming performance is so great, device don't get heat up at all even at high settings!I played PUBG Mobile and details it provides were so exciting and make it feel real. Shadows of tree,stones, mud, etc. If you have small hands don't buy it for gaming, don't feel comfortable with small hands.Camera is good, can't say it is awesome!Battery life is great too, charge too fast!UI is as expected stock android, some pre-installed third party apps were also installed, you can uninstall all of them except Netflix.The back cover they provide is loose and cheap. Have to buy a new better one!Over all a great phone!Cheers! :)

  Great phone, Amazon delivers it within 10 hours of ordering really happy there,Pros: Beast performanceGreat battery LifeBrilliant ScreenFluid 90hzAnd blazing fast oxygen os5gCons:Camera: have a 2megapixel camera for the sake of having 3 camera on the backRest of the camera are only averageHopefully upadates can fix that and given one plus history I think they will!Curved screen cause accidental touches and most covers can't cover phone fully in the front due to display Hence its prone to break more than regular flat screen phone like 7tHave a little bit of weight due to larger batteryPrincing is highly agressive but could have provided wireless charging and headphone jackIn the same price!Overall good phone if you want a future proof phone but this eyes closedBut if you are on a budget 7t can mostly get you there with better camera and almost as fast snapdragon 855plusChoose wisely

  Obviously, you might have done extensive research, watched many review videos before coming here to make your purchase decision. There is only one way you will be happy with this purchase and that is, if you are looking for a slim, elegant, powerful, light weight device offering a premium in-hand feel. Day to day, if this is what is most important to you, then this is the device to get.Camera is going to serve you well on many occasions (when the lighting is good). People might have told you that the camera system is mediocre. That is not entirely true. There have been few software updates and I can confidently say that yes, the camera is neither great nor is it bad. It delivers decent pictures (when the lighting is good) and if you are not a absolute camera geek, then this will meet and succeed all of your expectations. Incase you are a camera geek, then get the 8Pro and dont think about saving money.Conclusion: Feels expensive and has a nice balance in the hand (Its very light and is a joy to use). The glacial green in matte finish is makes the front of the device look expensive (with the dark edge-to-edge AMOLED panel). It performs like it should. It has an QC 865 after all! It will easily get you through more than a day with a full charge. Its a very low risk decision. Cant go wrong - Just buy the damn thing!

  After reading a lot of geeky reviews on YouTube and portals, I bought Oneplus7t. Pls, note I have been using OnePlus from last many years now so my expectations were clear. My experience with the device says that most of the reviews or unboxing things are influenced. Pls, note I have bought it with my own money unlike leading reviewers or unboxing video geeks who get it for free. So pls don't go by them blindly. Go for users reviews who bought them with their own money. So I am writing my 5 days experience with the phone.I am not a gamer or a geek. A regular user who wants to do all the office work on the phone, social media, blogging and vlogging, etc.The last OnePlus phone I was using was Oneplus 5 and was quite happy with it until it screen got broken and replacement cost was higher than the selling price of the device itself.The day it arrived from Amazon I opened it with a lot of excitement which continued till I have held it in my hands.Here are the issues:1. Weight: It weighed too much I felt like holding a brick. And it is thick. When I hold it in one hand for a few minutes I get a deep red pit in my hand (due to blood circulation).2. Camera: Then I had to go for a conference there I tried clicking pictures. Picture quality did not come out well. Still, I thought it may be light or background because of my previous experiences I could not believe it to be not good. So I continued clicking pictures which really missed detailing. As you zoom in it will make it blurred. I have clicked a magazine cover picture with my Oneplus 5 which had only 16 MP camera but pic quality was natural and good. It clicks blur pics may it has to do with image Stabilization.3. Battery:  Battery is avg. All those time I teased my iPhone or Samsung Series colleagues and friends for their battery life. Welcome to the league. This offers an avg battery life. I never carried a charger with me in previous models if I Start with 90% even after two years. But here I have to carry it even for the average usage. I m wondering what would be this phone battery life in a year or more.4. 90 Hz refresh rate is a gimmick to sell this device. It will give you fluid experience but the soon it consumes battery you will always prefer to keep it to 60hz which is an option given in the display settings. If you always stick to a desk or have a power source around you can keep it to 90hz. Not for people who are on the move most of the time. Don't fall for it.5. Sound: It's average. Phone calls are not crisp and clear. At times the caller's voice gets hazy and husky. Voice is even audible to person the person sitting next to me. Even on lower volumes. Speakers volume is loud but the sound quality is not good.6. No premium-feeling anymore. With multiple variants, it has joined the league of Samsung, Mi, Oppo, Vivo. Now they are launching 7t pro on Oct 10 again it is a disappointment for those who bought 7t on day 1. Maybe their R&D or trials have some problem here that in every two months they are launching a new device with an update to the previous faults. Like OnePlus 7 has voice receiver on one side which is right. So if you take calls or hear the phone from left you won't get a clear voice or volume. So they added receivers on both the side in this device.I am still not getting why I have spent Rs 40,000 on it. No camera quality, no battery life, no sound quality on calls, getting wounds on holding it for long.I have always recommended OnePlus devices to everyone around and had high hopes and trust on the brand that I bought it on the day of the launch but with this experience, I won't recommend OnePlus 7t to my colleagues and friends who are planning to upgrade their devices.

  I received One Plus 7T 2 days back. I will describe you my experience in these 2 days.Firstly, kudos to Amazon for such a quick delivery and excellent packaging.Coming to the mobile, the first impression is just amazing. Its smooth, fast and you can't come out of it.The amoeld display is stunning and camera is amazing. Battery backup is also too good. And it took me 40 min to charge from 2% to 100%.PROS:CAMERA - 4.8/5BATTERY- 5/5Display - 4.7/5Performance - 4.8/5Speed - 5/5Gaming experience- 4.8/5CONSNO Headset jack.One Plus didn't even provide 3.5mm Type C Converter either which dissapointed me.Camera design could have been made better (But I feel better compared to Apple 11 pro)Overall: 4.7/5  One Plus proves again why its the BEST MOBILE right now. Go for it.

  This phone has great performance, good camera and ambiance. Charging is fast as per the Oneplus standards set in earlier phones. What is concerning me is the heating issue which crops up off and on. The Battery drains quickly so we have to keep it at 60Hz to longer life. Is there anyone else feeling the heating issues?

  THIS IS ONE OF THE WORST PHONE I HAVE EVER PURCHASED. PLEASE DONT BUY THIS PHONE AND PUT YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY ON STAKE. THERE ARE SO MANY CONS IN THIS PHONE. EARLIER I HAVE USED ONE PLUS 5T PHONE SO I KNEW WHAT TO EXPECT FROM THIS PHONE BUT THIS TIME I AM SO MUCH DISAPPOINTED.HERE ARE MY CONCERNS1. SCREEN RESOLUTION AND QUALITY OF THE SCREEN IS SO POOR. THERE IS GRAINS AND COLOR BANDING ISSUE IN SCREEN. IMAGES LOOKS GRAINY AND UNSHARP IN COMPARISION TO ONE PLUS 5T OR 6T. PHONE RATIO IS 20:9 SO INSTAGRAM IMAGES WILL BE IN SHOWN IN PORTRAIT MODE INSTEAD OF LANDSCAPE MODE. IMAGES ON THE SCREEN IS SO BLURRRY2. DESIGN OF THE PHONE IS MESS. SO MUCH CAMERA BULK. EVEN THE PROVIDED CASE CANNOT PROTECT IT FROM SCRATCHES. PHONE IS VERY FAT AND HAEVY. LENGTH IS ALSO TOO MUCH BECAUSE OF THE RATIO. ALSO THERE IS NO PREMIUM FEELING AFTER HOLDING THIS PHONE AS WAS WITH THE ONE PLUS 5T.3. 3.5MM JACK IS BIG OMMISSION SINCE ONE PLUS 6 PHONE. THERE IS NO BENEFIT OF REMOVING IT. THERE IS NO BIGGER BATTERY. ALSO YOU HAVE TO BUY A SEPERATE ADAPTER OR NEW BLUTOOTH EARPHONES AND BLUTOOTH EARPHONES QUALITY CAN NEVER BE AS GOOD AS WIRED EARPHONES.4. CAMERA QUALITY IS AVERAGE. NO INCREASE IN PICTURE QUALITY. 3 CAMERAS ARE ONLY FOR NAME SAKE.I WAS VERY HAPPY ONE PLUS CUSTOMER, BUT NOW I WON'T RECOMMEND THIS PHONE TO ANYONE. PLEASE DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY.

  The smart Lock feature is not working on the phone. It doesn't require PIN/ fingerprint sensor sometimes. It gets unlocked by side power button which creates a big security issue. The battery back up is just pathetic. Not so great camera make is totally underserving for the kind of price OnePlus is selling this device. If option available, I would have asked for refund.

  The phone has a dark band on the status bar. As clearly seen in the photo. OnePlus 8 pro has some serious issues with its display. To reproduce the issue, you have to sit in a dark room with the lowest brightness possible in your device.

  When i was testing my device for any display issues i kind of felt white colors are a bit too warm which looked like it had some tint effect to it in my unit, so i went into display settings and changed the calibration to advanced and selected AMOLED wide gamut with a cool color tone. it seemed to be good and then after a while, i started noticing image retention issue which was visible in light gray background. so i tested it keeping full brightness and opening chrome incognito mode and i could see home screen icons visible there (as shown in picture).i called in for replacement but unfortunately, i can only get a refund due to low stock of op8prodisappointed a lot in the quality of oneplus devices for which we pay 60k.

  I bought the phone during the first sale on 15June.I was very excited for the phone due to all the hype on the social media and what not.It was amazing at first,blazing fast speed,120hz refresh rate and the display was gorgeous to look at,but after around 9th day,my display was having issues and after 11 days,half the screen would show a weird purple tint while watching youtube in dark mode and using chrome and apps with similar black color.My whole experience was ruined,so much that i sold the phone at ₹3000 loss.I'm 99% sure,no matter where you buy the phone,it would have some display issues in one way or another which is very disappointing.I urge you to stay away from this phone as the screen is not calibrated like it should've been.Totally not worth your hard earned money.

  I bought this 12GB+256GB Glacial Green variant and physically it looks stunning. The design is top-notch. The punch hole camera does not spoil the overall screen experience as some people have said. Very sleek and premium looking design-wise. The battery life does not last really long when you use it on 120 Hz QHD+, although it's quite manageable and can get through the day with mid usage easily. Coming to gaming, I'm a hardcore gamer and can game continuously for 3-4 hours, and let me tell you this phone can run through it with ease. I've played PUBG quite a lot on this device and have not noticed any major frame drops at HDR graphics and Extreme frame rates, let alone Smooth graphics. It runs PUBG really smoothly. Stable frames at all times. I would suggest it for competitive PUBG and other games too. The 120 Hz Amoled screen is breathtaking. Buttery smooth at all times. Certainly the best display on a phone. I have found the cameras to be decent enough. Nothing too fancy, nor a let down. Videos are very stable though. This has come close to the iPhone cameras as a video shooter. This might even offer better stabilization than the iPhone videos. The colour filter camera is disabled out of the box. Speakers are fairly loud and clear. A very good surround experience. You'll find a Dolby sample video in your gallery. Play it on the phone speakers and see for yourself.Here comes the bad part about it. The phone that I had received, I used it for about 2 weeks and discovered it had this image retention issue. The afterimage of anything displayed for a period of time on the phone for a long time is displayed on the screen even after the original image is pulled off. This could be seen while watching Youtube videos in non-fill screen mode or videos that have any kind of frame visible or even games like PUBG where static elements of game like the map's frame or your controls would be visible on certain background colours even after you have turned the game off. I had reset the phone and not seen any kind of improvement. I checked on the community and many people have experienced this issue as well. The hole-punch band issue is there but it was very vague and DC dimming could fix it. Also, my screen had no green tints. The image retention issue could easily turn into permanent screen burns really soon. So, I have returned my product for now and plan to buy the same phone again.Hope you people find this review useful. Not a very organized review but that's what I have experienced.

  ==== A lengthy & brutally honest review. It's worth the read if you plan on purchasing this device. ====I am a Design Specialist by Profession & also into Mobile Photography, hence I was hooked in using the Pixel 2XL. This phone is a worthy upgrade if you're transitioning from Galaxy S9 / Pixel 1 or 2 series / OnePlus 6, 6T & below / iPhone X or 7 and below.OnePlus 7T Pro is only an incremental upgrade over it's predecessor OnePlus 7 Pro.===== What has been improved over the 7 Pro? ====+ Faster Processor. Snapdragon 855 Plus.+ Adreno 640. Better Gaming Performance.+ Better Haptic Motor. Same as the 7T.+ Fast Charging. Warp 30T Technology.+ Brighter Nits (Upto 1000 compared to 800 of 7 Pro)+ Super Macro Mode, Night reading Modes, Android 10 out of the box, Better Nightscape 2.0. These software updates will be eventually updated for the 7 Pro as well.==== What's in the Box? ====OnePlus 7T Pro Device.User Manual.Transparent Silicon Case.SIM Ejector Tool.Warp 30T Charging Brick.Type C USB Cable.And some cool OnePlus Stickers.==== Display ====Firstly, OnePlus 7T Pro has a stunning display over its predecessors. I'm personally not a fan of notches nor do I click a lot of selfies, so I prefer the OnePlus 7T Pro's Fluid Display. Feels more luxurious over the 7T. It's marginally bigger to hold as well. I would recommend using a case so that the edges don't feel slippery. However, you should also note that in different lighting conditions, 7T Pro has glares at the curves due to the rounder corners which I believe is negligible. 90Hz is smoooooth. You would never want to get back to 60Hz once you're used to this.==== Performance ====Snapdragon 855 Plus is one of the best CPUs out there (at the time of writing this review) and with Adrena 640, it takes gaming and multi-tasking to another league. COD & PUB-G juices out at their best with 60FPS & is indeed smooth than imagined. 855 Plus is at par with the A13 Bionic from Apple. Haven't experienced any drops in frames. RAM Management is splendid & 8GB RAM is recommended unless you want to get the 12 Gig McLaren Edition to save on a few seconds everyday.==== Camera ====I honestly have to admit that it's not the best out there as I was expecting a leap from it's predecessors. It still uses the Sony IMX 586 (48 MP) for it's main sensor and it's Telephoto at 2.2X optical (3X lossless) and is at par with iPhone. But when compared with the GCam Mod, the OnePlus Camera seems to have improved a lot from it's previous versions. The Wide Angle is fairly okayish with some distortions being present at the edges. Nightscape is now available for Wide Angle shots too.==== Video ====If you're into Video Recording, then be a bit disappointed to hear this as it isn't the best while it can still take average videos without much shake utilizing the OIS and EIS at 1080P and just OIS at 4K 60FPS. It still doesn't shoot 4K in wide angle. Apple iPhone 11 takes the lead here. OIS and EIS combined together has a lot of warping and rolling shutter which is a turn off for video producers. It's still not an alternate for a Gimbal. The videos look oversaturated too which can be fixed by shooting on a Third Party app like Filmic Pro.==== Software ====This is one of the biggest features for you to switch to the OnePlus. Stock Android was butter smooth while I missed out on a lot of simple gestures like Longer Screenshots, Silence Button, Customized Navigational elements & much more which lacked on the Stock OS from Google. I would say Oxygen OS should be set as a benchmark for Google to include these incremental features on their upcoming flagships. Oxygen OS has presently the best OS Experience for Android.==== Battery ====Warp T30 is super fast. It helps you charge from 0-100 in lesser time than an episode on Netflix. Although not the fastest charger in the industry, it still gets through a day on heavy usage.==== What could've been improved ====- Minor improvements on Camera.- No ToF sensor- No Wireless Charging.- IP Rating.- Better silicon case should be included in their future upgrades.==== Verdict ====No doubt that the ASUS Fans would recommend the ROG 2. ROG 2 is hands down the best gaming phone with 120 HZ Display but lacks majorly on other aspects like software updates, Telephoto Camera, Splash Proof, Build Quality and security patches which are very essential for business professionals or regular consumers. ASUS is also not known to provide regular updates to it's consumers over the OnePlus which has a closely knit community among the developers and has more Brand Value than ASUS & nevertheless to mention that the OnePlus 7T Pro feels premium out of the box.If you're planning to upgrade from a device almost 2 years old then this would be the best upgrade in case you require a phone with no-notch and curved screen. 7T Pro feels very slippery when compared to the 7T. I wish they made smaller devices. Otherwise I would still recommend the 7T which is the best bang for your buck.If you still wish to own this but cannot afford the extra rupee on incremental updates (Fast Charging, 855 Plus) , my suggestion would be is to go for the OnePlus 7 Pro. It's still one of the best devices out there.

  I think I am the first one to write a review for this beauty :)  I ordered this at 11 PM in the night and It was there in my hand in the morning 9 AM.I have used iPhone X, Samsung s9 plus and Samsung s10 plus before coming to One Plus 7T.  My experience so far with this:1. Display: It's amazing. Sharpness, brightness and 90Hz displays makes it one of the most beautiful displays.2. Camera: All of my previous mobiles had great cameras. 7t Pro is nothing less than that. If you are a professional photographer, you might find differences. For a normal user, it's just perfect.3. Battery: I am getting a very good battery backup. When I go to bed, it's 30%. 30T Warp charger is a booom.4. Performance: Blazing and Lightning fast.5. One of the USP of OnePlus mobiles is its Oxygen OS. After using iPhone and Samsungs One UI, I can tell you that it's the best. Lots of gestures, shortcuts and very lightweight.The only Con I think it has is its weight. It's on the heavier side but after using it for few days now, I am getting used to it.Go for it guys !! You won't regret.

  Hi, When I open my this most awaited phone, I just saw 2 major Draw Back1st. The Camera Quality, Dear One Plus maker if we paid you 54000.00 (53999.00) then why we compromise with today's main features the CAMERA.The zoom quality is very poor, pic are RIP-UP,DURING ZOOM SHOT OR WHEN YOU SEE THE CAPTURED IMAGE WITH ZOOM.NIGHT PHOTOGRAPHY AND SHOT IS ALSO POORIN NIGHT PICTURES YOU SAW LOTS OF DOTS- RIP-UP.IMAGE NOT CAPTURED IN HIS ORIGINAL COLOR.THERE ARE LOTS OF ISSUES WITH CAMERA QUALITY.SO THINK ABOUT YOUR USERS AND GIVE A BEST QUALITY.Hope ONE PLUS Team look and work on it and solve this issue in his next software updates.Dear Amazon team pass this feedback to ONE PLUS TEAM.

  Amazing phone with an unbelievably smooth and vivid display.I had been using the OnePlus 5T before and a big fan of OnePlus cameras and OS.But I've always felt the OnePlus display wasn't good enough.This mobile just killed that thought.Highlights:1)Buttery smooth, fast and bright display -The edge display is just wowwww. You just can't stop admiring it.2)Excellent camera - The pictures come out so well in all kinds of lighting and modes.  *Portrait*- The new zoom mode in portrait is just wow.Looks exactly like DSLR clicks.  Macro - I love taking closeup shots of flowers and patterns and with this...you can get as close as 2.5 cms and click amazing shots.  Nightscape - This area is a huge upgrade compared to my OnePlus 5t.You get crisp and clear pictures without any noise.The pictures are now to the mark of Pixel mobiles.  Popup camera - If you are hesitant or doubtful about popup cameras...I am telling you there is nothing to worry...It is Soo smooth and quick that you never will notice it is a hardware controlled camera.Selfies have never been this better.Bright and sharp shots anytime.  Video - Haven't really used much.Will update later3)Dolby speakers - Excellent sound quality with awesome stereo effect.Once again a huge upgrade over the older models.4)90 Hz refresh rate - Yes this one gives you a totally different experience when using your mobile.It is clearly faster and better than the usual 60Hz displays.5)Build and design - Just perfect...It's sleek...stylish and neat. Loved the camera setup in OnePlus 7T but hated the circular bump.And I totally loved the edge display in OnePlus 7 pro.This device is just a perfect combination of the best features in the 7t and the 7pro and NOT an unwanted model like everyone is claiming.6) Batter and charging - The charging is blazing fast and the battery very easily lasts a whole day,even with 90Hz refresh rate.

   I was really happy to have this phone, switching from apple to android. The phone is really big and has lot of power in it, no problem in playing games, its like silk smooth games, navigation between apps, super fast. All updates were done for software and apps. I am in love with it.... ButAfter 2 days of normal usage and random navigation on the device. The device started rebooting itself, I was shocked but thought maybe just after reboot it will ok. But it rebooted for 3 hours continuously without any stop, till the whole battery got drained. I was not able to perform any action, it made me handicapped for 3 hours, where I cannot do anything... Check the videoFinally, I am returning it after long conversation with Amazon support and the OnePlus team.Buy at your own Risk..!!!

  No 3.5 headphone jack(Phone is thicker than 3.5 and there's plenty of space). No 3.5/C adapter provided in box. Never settle? No official adapter sold in Amazon either. You have to get registered on their website. Why?!Display seems to have a bit of yellow tint. Although fast, not really seeing the so called magic of 90Hz display. Overhyped. Curved edges make reading a bit weird: Lines go up from the left (curve on the left), then flat in the middle and then go down on the right(curve on the right)- Wish the OS provided a margin on both edges,if needed.

  Writing after month of use and experiment with camera. This is Not great compared to previous versions of one Plus, camera quality is very bad and photos looks burry and artificial. Especially low light photos are very bad, if you click a moon it will Look like a sunny sky, light enhancement and intelligent image processing has gone wrong. Otherwise its similar to older version of one plus and waste buying this if you already have a one plus. Infact I had one plus 6 which was much more better than this in terms of camera, I was comparing the images of one plus 6 saved to google which has much lesser resolution, one plus 6 pics looked great and near to reality where are 48 MP one plus 8 images looked blurry and full of senseless light and colour. Regretting have sold one plus 6 in a exchange offer.

  They kinda SETTLED with this one.1. You pay 50G for this hyped up device and chances are you will get a pre-applied screen protector with bubbles on it. Spend 50 grands worth to see bubbles on your screen?2. OnePlus 3T had a better camera than this, in my opinion. I'm not going by specs here. It's about how the rendered images look and feel. Some images are washedout as indicated on many online reviews and if you feel like zooming in on your shots, you will regret clicking that picture in the first place. OnePlus messed up by a big margin as compared to the iPhones and the Samsung's.3. They give you a silicon case along with the device which turns yellow within 15 days of normal use. Cheap show, OnePlus!Some pros: fast charging, great display (god I can't stand that iPhone notch that looks like a stupid haircut lol), good design, & fingerprint reader.Oh and their customer service is not as fancy as their marketing team. So careful with that too.OnePlus, Never Again!

  The product is not at all good. It's not value for money either. The build quality is good however the performance is not good. The phone lags and has several bugs. It hangs while switching between apps. The ringer, Bluetooth and wifi has performance issues and turns on off or disconnects automatically. Other than that, the phone automatically restarts. The VoLTE functions badly too. I'm not at all satisfied with the product. I would not recommend this phone to anyone. I'm stuck now. But it's better to go for other devices.

Why go for OnePlus 8 which is almost more than 20000 costly than Nord.I don't know whats the mindset of OnePlus behind launching of Nord with same configuration as OnePlus 8 and almost at half-price.Hence I will give only single star in value for money.

  First impression is its an absolute beauty.My personal review regarding OnePlus 8 Pro Ultramarine blue after using 24 hrs.Display:A stunning 120Hz display. Better brightness, even bright in low light also. No green tint / black crush issue found on my device.Camera:It is clear that only 3 rear camera are working right now. No color filter is working. It may redeaign and enable later via software update.Rather than every sensor of all camera working fine. Pictures taken by rear camera with all mode is so bright that u can find every details in the pictures.48 MP wide angle camera is take so wide and beautiful pictures.On front camera section it take good bright pictures, but i think in portrait mode it take little bit artistic image than real.Slow-Mo working fine. Macro working fine.Battery:Battery backup is good. 30 W Warp charger  chage the device very fast. 19 hrs before charging and its still 6 hrs left. Screen on time is approx 8 hrs.No wireless charger so dont know about wireless chaging.Oxygen OS:This is my 3rd OP devices and the best part which i love is its Oxygen OS. Everything nice. I personally want more Font style.OnePlus own gestures is also missing this time.Proximity sensor working fine. Pocket mode working fine. Fingerprint sensor is superfast. Face unlock also superfast.Sound & Vibration:Sound is good but i think ring volume is little bit low.Speaker is loud, you can use Dolby Atmos enhancement also. Heptic feedback is low which is good.Live Captions features is new this time.Network:OP 8 Pro not support our own navigation system NavIC right now. No announcement from OnePlus also. Qualcomm announced that its 865 Snapdragon processor support NavIC system. So dont worry ur hardware support NavIC. Maybe software update comes later.Screen guard/Back cover:Use CaseU tempered glass or GlazedInc tempered glass. Both r good and accurate fit.Use original karbon fiber/ sandstone case or use Ringke/UAG/Spigen case.If u interested to buy from Ali express then buy Nillkin back cover.Thank you.

  I've been using OnePlus 3 more than 4 years and it was time for an upgrade for obvious reasons. It was no brainer for me to go for a OnePlus device again as OP3 is still running fine and strong (although it does not handle the newer games like CODM fine anymore). Believe me guys, Oxygen OS is by far the best skin for Android.Now, coming to OP8 pro, I've used it for a day and I can say that it didn't disappoint me. Following are some of my observations.- Display is stunning, probably second to none.- Oxygen OS is still just awesome.- Haptic feedback while not the greatest, is still very good.- Even though the phone is heavy, I feel it's very well balanced. Very difficult to use with one hand.- Fingerprint scanner and Face unlocks works like a charm.- Design is great and the available color options are different and awesome.- Earpiece volume during calls are not the greatest but adequate. OP3 earpiece volume had deteriorated very much over time.- Rear Camera has improved a lot, but I can already feel that there are still rooms for improvement. Focus jumps quite a lot in tricky lighting. Need to do an in-depth testing. Also, the camera bump is quite prominent.- I did not find any green tint or black crush issues as reported by some International users as of now. But I can see a black bar running parallel to front camera module under the lowest brightness setting. But again I would suggest not use in full/high brightness all the time. Also, watch YT videos in landscape mode.- Lack of the 3.5mm headphone jack is the biggest let down for me in this phone.I'm yet to test a lot of things, will update after a few days of usage.Writing the review from my new OP8 Pro, it just feels great. The Ultramarine Blue is fantastic 😍.Finally, if the price is not a deal breaker, then I *Highly Recommend* this ""Flagship"" phone from OnePlus.

  Not happy. I am a long time customer of oneplus phones and since last 3 years I have been using oneplus 5 and that phone is as good as new. Here are some of the issues I am facing with the new onplus 8 pro.- Battery - The phone doesn't last one day with full charge. I dont play any games, my phone usage is mainly social media, instagram,facebook,reddit, twitter and bunch of other photo edit tools like lightroom and snapseed. If I charge full and start my day, then by evening 8pm  my phone is battery saver mode. Which is not the case on my oneplus 5 even after 3 years. It lasts comfortably until night one one charge. Yes war charging is faster, but the charge which doesn't last one full day is conerning for me. Since I travel long distances most of the days. And its more concerning because I don't use any of the power hungry games or apps. Btw I have removed 120hz refresh rate on the first week itself and all this battery issue is even when I am using it at 60hz refresh rate with default app/battery settings.Overheating - This is again a strange issue. I bought the oneplus 8 pro selling my DSLR camera so that I can record all my videos on phone itself plus its waterproof. Recently I shot a video at 4k 60fps and I guess within few minutes the phone got so heated that it disabled the camera from video shooting until the phone cooled down!! Now whats the use if I cant record a video even for few minutes straight on 4K?Camera - To be honest, stabilization is really great while recording video however photos are almost as good as oneplus 5 if not slightly better. But nothing that worth paying double the price you pay over oneplus 5. Video clarity is really great, far better than the oneplus 5. Wide angle is the only thing I felt is worth compared to oneplus 5.Apart from the above rest of the things are good I feel. Especially look and feel, screen is really good. Even the build quaility feels nice. Tested in rain couple of times and it worked great. Fingerprint lockscreen works mostly 70% of the time.Overall I regret buying the phone. Even if they had fixed the battery issues, this phone would have been a great choice.AnnyArun

And then I set 'Spherlue Icons' from theam and now its looks better with dark mode ...Even though its 6000 Mah I always leaves phone on charging before go to bed ( I like to see my phone 100% every morning 🙂 )..  So I turned off fast charging option.. You can do that.. Its will not affect  batteryMONSTER :1. Battery :- 5/5Two day battery standby for normal easy2.Display:- 4.99/5Super amaload with full hd.. Superb Display3.Design:3/5It has a6000Mah battery,  still looking not bulky. Noglass body,  but who cares after you put a back cover..  In my opinion, don't spend more money for glass body if you uses back covers4. Camera: 3/5Back camera pretty good but front camera's low light output is very low..  many features available such as slow and super slow videos available..5. OS&UI:- 5/5Android 10 with One UI6.Finger print reader and face lock 3/5 Face lock and finger print reader are not so fast7.Processor and performance 3.5/5Exynos 9611 is not meant for PUBG gamers  .. But for me its perfect as I am not a heavy gamer..  No lag ang hang till now..  but processor is outdated..8. Charging :2.5/5. No fast charging.. Provided with a 15W charger and iy takes about 3 Hrs to fully reacharge the phone9. Accessories : 2/5No earphone, No Back cover, No Screenguard..  So order backcover and tempered glass when you placing order as its backbody is plastic amd more prone to scratches..10.Loud speaker 1.5/5Loudspeaker sound level is very low.. (Keep earphones)Verdict: For this price  Its the best choice if you are not a hardcore gamer  ...

Its just a market gimic to clail it monester like features i.e.battery 6000mAH ,15W fast charge ete but reality is far far away from claims.Others features are as per price range but if you thinking for a battery packed phone with fast charge,then I would sugget plz search for others phone in same range.

The feel it gives is simply amazing.But battery dont seem to be a 6000 mah.As far as a non gamer is concerned this phone is the best under this price range.

  Pros - everything is perfect except display.

Specially if it has manufacturing defects.Price is 55k for the phone but it's not worth with this faulty display. Nobody has this much time to visit service center now and then. Even i tried to call customer service but my call is on wait for 1 hour no body picks up so who will be responsible for our device problems?If this display issues can be solved then they would have been solve it in past 2 months

  Facing major problems:1. Black bar, black crush issue and red tint across the display. ( Attached photos for reference)2. Significant discoloration on display with uneven brightness. ( clearly visible in the photos)3. OnePlus has tried to dampen the issue by increasing the minimum brightness, now its uncomfortable to use in the dark, with so bright screen glaring at you. ( Trying to get away)Seems to be prominent in the Indian unit.No response from amazon or OnePlus till now. This is totally unacceptable. Your silence on this is shameful.For you it might be just another phone, For me it is hard earned money that they I have saved up for monthsHighly disheartened with this purchase.Request to Replace or Refund this purchase.

  The outer looks of the phone is just delightful, SD865 is just wow!!. Started seeing some black bars in lower dialer screen with default wallpaper and also in chrome browser. Front and rear camera really sucks. Camera seem to be ordinary as <15k budgeted phone. Battery is really utter waste thing with less usage it lasted for 4 hours. If someone is looking for great flagship. Never go for this. You will regret for the rest of your life. I was amazed by the youtube review videos about this phone. But it don't deserve to be a flagship phone. Most features are just a gmmick to attract customers. Green tint has not been fixed yet. Everyone who buys this. Please check it thoroughly by sliding brightness where you can see RGB tint. Am returning it for refund.CAUTION: Never buy this. If your are looking for a great camera and battery. Numbers seem to be awesome. But they are not up to the mark. This is my honest review on this. Rest is upto you.

  I have been a OnePlus user from few years.And I have upgraded it from OP 6.I must say I have made the right decision.Pros: fast phone, 24 hours + battery backup, wonderful screen, no hanging, no lagging, optimzed oxygen OS.Cons: Camera is still not upto the mark, especially in low light. Sometimes it over expose images. But I think it will be fixed in the future update. So no worries.Final Verdict: Go and grab it. 8GB + 128GB is good enough for moderate users.PS: people who are still waiting for ""pro"" just don't think about the price. There are lot of things which you will be bound to buy if you get pro model. (4000₹) wireless charger, etc. So add that value also to the phone value.

  I received the phone yesterday... But there are some issues in functioning. I hope that will be resolved in coming updates as I blindly trust one plus brand.

  I bought OnePlus 8(8 GB variant ) in Glacial Green on 29th May 2020 and received it on 2nd June 2020.As a OnePlus product, we are bound to expect Strong performance, fast charging, good battery backup, decent camera quality, and overall smooth user experience. And I can say that One Plus has not lead us down again.The touch is super smooth, face unlock is fast as a blink of an eye, I constantly use google assistant which response pretty well, I am blown away with the camera quality and audio quality that is powered by Dolby Atmos.Apart from the strong base of hardware and software the phone has some pretty cool features that I have been loving for instance Digital Wellbeing, Work-Life Balance mode, Quick reply in landscape ,Zen Mode, customization for each application that helps in optimization and intelligent functioning.The phone connects pretty fast to wifi and Bluetooth devices. Does not lag or heat up. I have used this phone for my online meetings as well, the screen renders images and videos pretty well.All in all this a great deal and I highly recommend buying this phone.

  Awesome experience with ONEPLUS.Buttery smooth 90 hz display 😍Color accuracy and brightness of displayYou will be just in love with display of device.Haptic vibration feedback on ONEPLUS 8 is awesomeDevice is very light weight in hands.Cameras are decent and produce decent pictures in day light and struggle little bit in artificial lighting. yet to be tested in detail.Overall look , feel , battery and everything is great and cameras are decent for day to day usage.Juat go for Glacial Green Color. Its fantastic. I was confused between onyx black and Glacial Green but I think i made right decision.Glacial green is best color OnePlus ever made.If want to buy this device just go for it. You will not be disappointed

  It hangs every 5 hours, I started using it a week after receiving due to covid security reasons. Now return period has been over and i have no clue what to do with this garbage. It gets automatically turned off and troubles while turning on. I want a replacement if possible. I had put my previous money to buy it and now i have lost my trust in oneplus.

   You'll understand why I rated this phone 2 out of 5 🌟. First of all, I m not new to OP. I had OP6 earlier. I am writing this review after 10 days.Battery backup is not like Op6 (OP6 had better).My OP6 had some issues like disappearance of networks and rebooting again and again. I went to service centre they told me it's motherboard is failed. It ll take me Rs. 18000-20000 to get motherboard replaced. So I had to buy new one. Now after 3 days of use same issue happened in OP8 too, like disappearance of networks n power button wasn't working I had to use power button+ volume up+ volume down altogether to reboot it again which was highly disappointing and annoying too.Not only this when I play game at bottom of the screen I can see some disturbance too which u can c in screenshots and videos I uploaded with the review. There is no 3.5 mm jack if u don't want to switch to wireless headphones as I dn like to use wireless ones. I hv asked for replacement but it's been more than 24 hours I haven't received a single email after appointment with the technician. Yesterday I set it to full brightness to worship outside in sunlight and I received a prompt in phone about my phone's temperature So it has heating issues too. Go through the images n video n ull get to understand that y u shud wait for another version or look for another options. Highly disappointed with its performance. Thank you.Hope u ll find it helpful.

  Its been one week since i am with Oneplus 8, hope this is right time to write down whats good and whats been missed from my earlier deviceBeen a samsung s8 user for 3 years, its right time to upgrade and my search from beginning of this year end up with Oneplus 8Its been wait for 6gb variant and even a DM to OP team didnt helped in identifying sale date of 6Gb varient, then made my my mind for 8GB, reason i felt i am okay with 6gb is because i am not a person to play game in mobile rather use ipad for sameNow the bests:- Sceptic about downgrade of QHD screen to FHD+, surprised the screen quality is impressive- Size factor, smaller 5.8 to 6.55inches to my longer hands it is perfect enough- Sound, far better than S8- Just to give a try on game tried asphalt 9 it is buttery smooth- Battery - pretty impressive, charges constantly in 1hour time, gives 2 full days with Screen on time around 5-6 hours, in one week just charged 3 times- 90HZ to say it is awesome- Camera looks decent for my usage, have to see when i do prints- No complaints on curved screen may be i am used to it last 3 years, so op8 screen looks better too with curvesCons:- first 2 days had issues with Wifi, it was getting turned off automatically once i dont get phone in hand for some hours,not sure it was adopting to usage, now it looks normal- Glacier green from certain angles looks fadedMissing from Samsung S8:- Now have to worry about getting devices in rains of Bangalore- Samsung pay definitely a best of misses, never carry wallets earlier- So many sensors like heart rate, step counts, Health app etcOverall at current market this device looks good for the money spent, will post future experiences too after some time

  I am fully impressed with this phone after 2 weeks of usage.I was using a LG G3 before this and had to buy the phone because of a pcb board failure.( had also replaced the battery last year)Within 3 weeks I had done my research on various models at various price pointssome of the phones I considered wereMoto G5 plus----> excellent reviews all over, but camera is a compromiseMoto Z play------> good battery life...but specs wise ok and additionally it is made to support the moto mods so design looks funny with the pins at the backHonor Pro 8----> phone has some heating issues while using cameraOne Plus 5---> other than jelly effect no significant issues seen on the internetIPhone 6S ----> if IOS fan, then go for it but take the higher memory version as 32gb is too small for Ios apps.IPhone 7----> camera not as good as galaxy s8 , pixel or one plus. please see the comparisons online. why spend so much when one plus 5 is available at nearly half the priceLG G6 & Samsung S8---> did not consider Korean phones especially after my experience with G3.coming to the phone usage. I will not speak about the specs as most reviews highlight it in detailwhat I liked!Blazing fast  while opening closing apps etcCamera is quite good! I would not rate it as good as pixel, but produces very acceptable quality in most lighting conditionsdesign is very slim. fits comfortably in one hand. but I would recommend a case as it is slippery especially while trying to take selfiesVideos are with Electronic image stabilisation ( 4K too) which is brilliant!Dash charge is very good!latest OS 4.5.8 update is available also to downloadwhat I dislikedCamera app is very basic. not so much customisations such as gesture shutter. there is a smile shutter which is too responsive and clicks away!Gallery app is also very vanilla. although we can create collections, it cannot be uploaded to google photos.Battery life is a question mark especially over 2-3 years as currently even with moderate usage It gets me through a day ( but most phones have this problem so its not a deal breaker )Display legibility is not great especially under direct sunlight. this could be corrected with adaptive brightness but then indoors it becomes too bright.so drains the batteryOther than display legibility most of the above cons can be fixed by software updates I guess.I have also uploaded some pictures I took under different condtions. please note that I did not set any condtions or modes.I just pointed and shot as I am no expert in photography :)overall I am very happy with the 2 weeks I have used it.Without any fear , go for it!

  Pro:1. Quick processor2. Nice ram management3. Ultra fast storage4. Unparalleled DASH charge5. No heating during multitasking/heavy usage.6. OOS 4.5.x looks and feels better than the version in 3/3T. I am sure the little issues will be taken care of, soon.7. AptX support for better wireless audio.8. EIS - the hype is real. Works better than OIS.9. Camera is better than 3/3T. Videos look great after update. Decent front camera. But more on it in cons.10. Amazing battery life.Cons:1. Speaker is louder than 3/3T for sure but sounds cheap.2. Sound via headphone jack is also better than 3/3T, but lacks the power to drive high quality headphones.3. Inbuilt equalizer is the worst there is. An update can easily fix that.4. Dual camera setup. OP should have opted for a wide angle combi instead of zoom. That would have been more useful. Pictures in low light are still noisy. Bokeh looks artificial/overprocessed.5. The screen isnt as bright as 3/3t. Legibility under sunlight can be an issue for some. Also, same old 1080p can be a bummer. I personally dont mind the trade off for battery life.

  1. Processor:The OnePlus5 is the first phone in India to have the advanced Octacore 10-nanometer design Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 chipset. Combined with the 6GB (or 8GB for the 128GB variant) of RAM, it can not only render graphics faster but is also more battery efficient.2. Camera:OnePlus5 also comes bundled with a dual camera setting. While the front camera is of 8-megapixel, the two rear cameras are a combination of a 16-megapixel lens and a 20-megapixel telephoto lens.Both the lens is made by Sony and the primary camera has an aperture of f/1.7 while the secondary camera has an aperture of f/2.6. The telephoto lens will offer up to 2x zoom and both the lenses will combine together to capture impressive photos with a greater depth of field, akin to the portrait mode of the iPhone 7 Plus.3. Dash Charge:In the fast paced world, the faster the phone charges, the better it is. And the OnePlus’s Dash Charge proves that point beyond a doubt. Just like the OnePlus 3/3T, the OnePlus 5 also comes packed with the mighty Dash Charger.The Dash Charge is capable of charging the phone from 0-60% in just 30 mins and that’s more than impressive.4. OS:The Oxygen OS software has been updated to Oreo in the last week that we have been using it. It adds some light, useful and tasteful customizations on top of stock Android that add value. It’s not easy to get the software right and it’s impressive how OnePlus can strike the right balance so early in the game. I particularly find gestures (including alternate actions you can assign to navigation keys) and the left home screen pane very helpful.5. Battery And Audio:The 3300mAh battery on the OnePlus 5 can comfortably last for one moderate usage day. On particular heavy usage days, you will have to resort to mid-day charging. The Dash charge is incredibly fast as ever and will prove to be a big convenience. It, however, works only with the Inbox charger and cable.The loudspeaker on the phone is present on the bottom edge. It’s quite average in terms of loudness but the audio quality is reasonable. Audio output via headphones is very good. The call quality on the phone is excellent.But After So Much Some Things Got Missed Like*OIS Camera Stabilizer*Not IPS Certified*2K Display Resolution*Also Dual Camera Needs Some FixesBut over all its a power packed phone with a reasonable price.#And 5T has made some improvements on camera which are missing on 5 but Front Fingerprint Scanner lover chosse Oneplus 5 😉.Thats all, Hope I have helped a lot.

  Using this phone from 1 week. Faced no problems. They have given lot of shortcuts and options for user friendly experience. Don't use this phone without back cover. Once you add a good back cover it is very handy. Camera of one plus 5 is best in this price range. Dual camera really makes a lot of difference. Avoids noise because of 2x zoom. Front cam is also good. Battery charges very fast and you can get along a whole day with it. Sound quality is also good.

  The mobile display on the screen has vanished and no images are visible on the screen even when the instrument was used sparingly  for watching videos on you tube since it was delivered to me on 28th June(only two months back). On making a search on google it appears that many other buyers have also faced similar problems with this model.It appears that there is some manufacturing defect and therefore the instrument needs to be replaced immediately.I have already lodged my complaint (No.1402504 dtd.29.8.2017) with the customer care department.of the company.I have been given to understand that the instrument will be repaired free of cost.But since the malfunction/damage has occurred within the warranty period of One year I would like the instrument to be replaced forthwith.

  Writing this review after using the phone since August-17. It was difficult to get into Android after using iPhone, but never regret this buy for the below points.1. Finger print sensors are with good speed.2. Faster application speed than all the other phones, found better speed than my iPhone 6.3. Good app interface, can't beat iPhone in this aspect, yet 1+ doesn't compromise.4. I have installed 200+ apps and yet it doesn't hang for any games. Games like assassin's Creed run real smooth.Recommend to buy it if you are looking for a phone below 40k.

  I am posting this review after using the device for almost 30 days and I would like to divide my review into pros and cons.(Using 8 GB ram variant)∆ WHAT'S INSIDE THE BOX ∆The box looks like any other mobile phone box , nothing much fancy .Inside the box we get1) Device itself2)User manual and some paperwork.3)Dash charger and cable.∆ PROS∆1) Design-It's a pro or con depending on each user's, if you look pass the Appleish design the build quality is amazing .It has curved back which feels really good when you hold it in hand.2)Top notch specs.3) Stock Android with minimal bloat and fast updates (I have received 3 till now)4)No-heating issues-I have used this device for many days and I must say this device barely heats up while doing intensive tasks, thanks to the Snapdragon 835.5) Excellent Camera-Day light photography is excellent but in low light it's a hit or a miss.6)Fast fingerprint scanner.∆CONS∆1) Display is still Full hd2) Battery is not that great even with Full hd display (This could be fixed with an  software update)3)No Sd card slot.4) Price could have been less.Overall Iam pretty happy with the device and I highly recommend this to anyone over honor 8 pro.Thanks ✌️

  I charged the phone completely out of the box and then turned it on.  It went to the Oneplus logo screen but did nothing after that.  No buttons work, no combinations of any buttons do anything to take it out of logo screen, it won't even turn off.  Amazon won't allow return until technician looks at the phone???  Oneplus support said take it to a service center but couldn't tell me the closest one.  Really disappointed in lack of support form both companies for a brand new product and release.  I'm sure they will now try to push a replacement but I'm not really interested in the product anymore.

  This has by far been the best phone I have ever used hands-on. Flagship Specs, Classy look, Premium Packaging and the Speed you Need!Appearance - The device looks very much similar to the OnePlus 6T upfront but it has got the speed orange highlights at the back, carbon finish and McLaren Branding at the bottom.Camera - The night mode really captures amazing pictures and the portrait mode is just amazing. The low light photography could still be improved.Battery - With average usage with full day data on, it easily lasts upto 2 days. The Warp charging is just amazing, it takes around 40-45 mins to charge from 0-100%. But you could easily get a day's charge within 20 mins.Speed - With 10 Gigs of RAM, speed should not be a question. You could open up 5 high specs games and it still wouldn't lag. And its bragging rights for sure!Overall, I am really satisfied with this device and feels great to be a part of OnePlus Community! Go, get it! Its for those, who are in continuous pursuit for speed!

  Brought this phone for my wife who is die hard fan for oppo...Offer like 2000 extra off on exchange with Oppo is just like waww....So after exchange of her old oppo mobile I got this phone for just Rs.6800.... Best phone if u want oppo brand name and u are boared to ur old oppo phone... So this review is considering 6800 cost...Pros.1) good features considering cost 6800.2) Size matters 6.5 inch grt3) Speakers are good Dolby4) Comes with classic headphones with good looks and decent sound quality... No other phones now a days comes with headphones...5) Quad camera gives good quality photos...6) Selfie camera is also decent considering cost 68007) 5000mAh battery8) can be use as power bank for other phonesCons:1) Original cost 13990 is huge considering features...Other good brands like MI, VIVO, MOTO, etc sells 48MP camera phones for 12000 and so...2) Accessories like back cover, tempered glass are yet not in market... May be u have to wait for them...Though 1 transparent back cover is included in Mobile Box...This is all about this phone after 24hrs use....I will update if something comes...

  Brought this phone for my wife who is die hard fan for oppo...Offer like 2000 extra off on exchange with Oppo is just like waww....So after exchange of her old oppo mobile I got this phone for just Rs.6800.... Best phone if u want oppo brand name and u are boared to ur old oppo phone... So this review is considering 6800 cost...Pros.1) good features considering cost 6800.2) Size matters 6.5 inch grt3) Speakers are good Dolby4) Comes with classic headphones with good looks and decent sound quality... No other phones now a days comes with headphones...5) Quad camera gives good quality photos...6) Selfie camera is also decent considering cost 68007) 5000mAh battery8) can be use as power bank for other phonesCons:1) Original cost 13990 is huge considering features...Other good brands like MI, VIVO, MOTO, etc sells 48MP camera phones for 12000 and so...2) Accessories like back cover, tempered glass are yet not in market... May be u have to wait for them...Though 1 transparent back cover is included in Mobile Box...This is all about this phone after 24hrs use....I will update if something comes...

  Best option for exchange, I got it in 9k ,Review score (out of 5)Design : 4.5 (finger print scanner position is bit high), other things like screen size, corners,back panel, camera position are perfect and it's light weight too...Sounds quality : 5/5 (unexpected, dual side stereo and Dolby is awesome, loudness, clarity and effects are far better then any other phone i.e. mi 7 pro, Lenovo, Samsung or honor)Photography : it's similar to other available options in market, day light as usual is very clear and crisp, didn't get time for more night photography, but few repetitive uploaded pics are in night mode with very minimal light which are good.Battery backup : best in this category (10% ~ 3 hours of heavy uses) , for heavy uses 30hours for normal uses it ll go up to 2 days.Performance : not played many games but seems good, while opening any game auto memory cleaner will run,lag and heat issue is not there (checked continuously 1.5 hours)Memory space : 46 GB free space, all basic apps are pre installed, separate as card slot is available (apart from 2 SIM slot), 1.86 GB ram available after all updation, while playing any game also 900 to 1 GB space is availablePros : apart from above mentioned points :1)Front cam is good like other similar phone (mi, real me, honor, Samsung)2) earphones quality/look is very good in this range.3) dual speaker position is in front top of display and near to charging pin, so stereo comes properly4)face detection is fast5)no heating issue while charging /YouTube /gaming6) battery is lasting for more than 4 days on normal usesCons:1) fingerprint scanner position is bit high2) ram 6 GB would have a perfect option3) macro photos are not that good compare to redmi 7 pro4) no fast charger with pack

  Oppo makes very nice phone at this price range about quad cameras but we have another option to select Realme smartphones which is comparatively low budget and good cameras...But this phone I like mostly in battery back up with type C charger.. and also like camera clearity because I have already attached some snaps here from my Oppo A5 2020...Overall good performance of this phone and speaker was nice sounds which is have dual atmos..Thanks Oppo

  So, I ended up ordering this for my mother. I think I am going to keep it for myself.So far so good, 1st day of usage-If we say that One Plus and Iphones are 9/10s or 10/10s then Oppo F17 Pro is-Battery Charging Capacity- 8/10Battery Lasting Capacity- 8/10Rear Camera- 8/10Front Camera- 8/10Screen- 9/10Sound- 9/10Comes with a cover, ear phones and a charger which is indeed amazing.The phone is surprisingly good. It has a good camera which has multiple modes to click photos. It's front camera is top notch. I think if you get this phone for less than 20k by exchanging your old phone, it is totally worth it.It is a very light phone btw. Easy on the eyes and easy on the pocket.This is a day 1 review, first impression and a few hours of usage after full battery. It charges real quick btw.Shall update and edit this review in future if anything changes.Oppo has caught up with One Plus phones and with this budget phone, it has moved a step ahead.Buy it without any regrets if you can exchange an old phone and get this within 20,000.Go for it.

  My initial thoughts of the productDesign 5/5 - it is great to see a brand put emphasis on design aspect of phone, it is sleek and light - great to holdCamera 5/5- the dual front camera at this price is good, the best part about both cameras was the color portrait with black and white backgroundCharging and battery 5/5 - charging was really fast and I am satisfied with the 30w charging.Performance 5/5- the display and performance of the phone is also really good.

  The phone is sleek and very handy. Having 8gb of RAM is the best thing, the phone is fast, responsive. The only thing that I felt Oppo could have made better was the front camera. It not only feels that images captured are artificial but also have very less details captured. Overall the phone battery life is very good, quad camera produces top quality images. I will give this phone 4.5 rating...

  I had ordered this phone on the launch day and I received it on 10th September. After 2 days of usage My detailed reviewPros :1) Very Light and very slim2) 30Watt VOOC charge which charges phone in less than an hour3) Display4) Battery Backup ( not a gamer )5) Rear Quad Camera has separate separate lens cover for each lens which makes easy for replacing lens cover later.Cons :1) I think Camera is not up to the mark2) Editing options are very less even though AI is there.3) Charging adapter is too heavy of course it's a 30watt charger4) Finger print sensor response is lowConclusion :I love this phone coz it's really very very light and slim and I am not a gamer and I am not a heavy camera user. So For camera lovers and Gamers this I don't recommend this phone. But others who just love slim phone, just buy this phone. It's really awesome however camera is good but not the best. So think and buy.

  It is good phone but not best in this price range as it is not value for money product. It has 4 cameras in rear but 2 cameras are just good for nothing. Oppo just showed to customer that they are giving 4 cameras in rear. Phone back is totally plastic whih may get impacted in case of any fall. Processer can be snapdragon but they are offering mediatek. Now focus on some postive things where design in amazing. Phone has amoled display which makes it perfect in its category. Screen size, ram,memory, battery are great.

  This review's to all those who were eagerly waiting for the phone to launch and get hands on, but before all it's always hard to get the ""DEMO"" at the earliest so.. ""IMAGES"" above are to those who can't find demos much often/needed color/to avoid contacts at stores during Covid.Pros - Leather back warmth feelCons - Back Camera's not upto the mark when compared to the phones in market and of this price range, though it has given a sleek and leather finish with minimized thickness. . It's pro fades out its Con so can go for it blindly but only if you think ""CAMERA'S"" not your ""PRIORITY""Features I thought would be there was 9.1 surround music/Dolby Atmos but it comes with:Real Sound Technology, just have a look into it if you're specific2. Super Amoled+ Display.Hassle free(Inside the box):Tempered glass comes on the phone itself so no extra work on fixing, which might sometimes go wrong.2. Silicon back case (if you're looking for touch and feel of leather back, better not use.. but use a side bumper if available for protection) Do also post where we can find side bumper, cos it's hard finding for new phones.. Thanks!Looking for a Standout design in 15-20k range? Then, ""GO FOR IT"" that's Value for money!

  Hi, I am writing this review after 3 days of usage1. Firstly thanks to Amazon. Got delivered at a lightning speed. Ordered ok Saturday. Launch date was on 21st September and got delivered the same day at morning.2. Now about Oppo 17, this is very light weight, speed is good, I ordered dynamic orange. Trust me, this is the best and attractive colour I found ।l, blue is a good option too if you don't like a funky coloir।3. Camera I did not found upto the mark . Night mode is not that great but yes if you are a selfie person, go for it. I was using Ralme Xt earlier and it's camera was much better. But ok I will manage . I am a part time photographer and often I use my phone to click pics. Realme supported me a lot. Let's see how much Oppo supports.4. Speed is good. 6 GB 128 GB. Good combo. No lagging till now. Going smooth.5. Touch is awesome. Phone gets unlocks quickly. No lagging here too .Rest I will use for some more days and come back with my reviews again.

  i like the camera quality, images and videos are sharp and clear. there is a wee bit of noise in low light areas but it can be overlooked.it looks quite a bit like the iphone X but is largerdisplay is on par with iphone xmusic sounded as good as iphone xi could just unbox and get on with it as oppo provided the tempered glass, back cover as well. which was a pleasant surprise as I was not expecting. 😄Also the design, finger print sensor on display, face recognition .... lot of features.dual 4G standy by with an SD card is a blessing and I was looking for exactly what this phone offered at the right price and also the back cover made  of leather is so freaking rich and classy.quite happy with what I got. This is probably the fastest decision I have ever taken around buying a phone and I am hoping this will last long, like most of my other phones.

  So it's been three days since I'm using this phone and I'm completely in love with it at the price I got.1. Weight of the Phone is very less when compared to any phone in this segment and this matters a lot to me while carrying or casual music listening or any stuff.2. Back leather type wrapper is really good and gives a premium feel.3. UI is also good in terms of usage and mobile handling and compatibility4. Camera is decent for video calls/ normal phots not that great especially for shotting long-distance objects/ sceneries. But this doesn't matter to me a lot. Come on use a professional camera if you want photography at peaks.5. Design is excellent and it is the slimmest phone at 7.43mm6. Build Material quality is good.7. Sound is good but not that great for melodies or any songs please use earphones/headphones.8. Display is really good and it's out of my expectation as I'm using Samsung AMOLED previously.9. Processor is fast for general purpose and played COD and some other games at medium graphics didn't observe any lag.10. Battery is okay and keeps you charged up for one day (General usage with low- medium gaming)11. Software is fast and no clutter apps or extra apps.Overall I would definitely recommend if someone wants a nice phone for general usage which looks classy.

  It's not worth for this amount after Unboxing and using it for a moment I feels like that, because I am using oppo mobiles more than 3 yearsBut this product is okay by weightless,fast charging  but not okay with with cameras,finger print accessibility, battery performances,And processor is snap dragon 662 nothing more specific things .So oppo have to launch little bit better quality product for this amountDynamic orange 🍊,first you realise the colour of orange and this phones colourDon't try to give fake colour or spread fake informationsSo I don't suggest to buy this product to anyone

  Update (15/08/2020):Never give a chance to regret..  Go ahead...👍The Icons looks was not so great ..  And then I set 'Spherlue Icons' from theam and now its looks better with dark mode ...Even though its 6000 Mah I always leaves phone on charging before go to bed ( I like to see my phone 100% every morning 🙂 )..  So I turned off fast charging option.. You can do that.. Its will not affect  batteryMONSTER :1. Battery :- 5/5Two day battery standby for normal easy2.Display:- 4.99/5Super amaload with full hd.. Superb Display3.Design:3/5It has a6000Mah battery,  still looking not bulky. Noglass body,  but who cares after you put a back cover..  In my opinion, don't spend more money for glass body if you uses back covers4. Camera: 3/5Back camera pretty good but front camera's low light output is very low..  many features available such as slow and super slow videos available..5. OS&UI:- 5/5Android 10 with One UI6.Finger print reader and face lock 3/5 Face lock and finger print reader are not so fast7.Processor and performance 3.5/5Exynos 9611 is not meant for PUBG gamers  .. But for me its perfect as I am not a heavy gamer..  No lag ang hang till now..  but processor is outdated..8. Charging :2.5/5. No fast charging.. Provided with a 15W charger and iy takes about 3 Hrs to fully reacharge the phone9. Accessories : 2/5No earphone, No Back cover, No Screenguard..  So order backcover and tempered glass when you placing order as its backbody is plastic amd more prone to scratches..10.Loud speaker 1.5/5Loudspeaker sound level is very low.. (Keep earphones)Verdict: For this price  Its the best choice if you are not a hardcore gamer  ...

  I am writing my review after using it for 6 days.I have bought sumsung phone after 7 years hoping it could be good phone but samsung again disappointed me a lot.They claim it has 6000mAH battery but drain like 3000mAH and it take almost 2.30hrs to charge from 10% to 90% so its fast charging is not a fast charging. Its just a market gimic to clail it monester like features i.e.battery 6000mAH ,15W fast charge ete but reality is far far away from claims.Others features are as per price range but if you thinking for a battery packed phone with fast charge,then I would sugget plz search for others phone in same range.

  Value for money.I am not a gamer. So can't say about the gaming performance. But for those who are buying it for normal usage, this phone is great. With 6gb ram,128 GB internal storage and Amoled display I am more than satisfied.I have been using Samsung phones from the start. Samsung's Amoled screen is what I am attracted to the most. The feel it gives is simply amazing.But battery dont seem to be a 6000 mah.As far as a non gamer is concerned this phone is the best under this price range.

  This phone makes sense only for a very specific set of people. Bought this after a lot of deliberation on whether to go the one plus way or the oppo find x.  I am a person who uses an S9, and super heavy user. Atleast 2 full charges a day. Not for games but professional use. emails, conf calls and video.Chose this one barely on three factors.In 30 min you get near full charge. This phone is worth for that one reason.Screen, a 120hz screen does make a huge difference compared to S9 that I own.Speaker - One of the best speakers.Plus 5k discount and a one-time screen replacement warranty.Cons - The charger shape is not ideal. If I plug it in, it interferes with the next plug point or the switch. Should have been lighter and the cable should have been higher quality.ColorOS 7.1 actually turned out to be way better than I thought. It is minimalist, material design, and fast. But still should have provided an option to remove the few remaining out of the box apps.I don't worry about IP68 and Camera. In the last 15 years, I have dropped the phone only once in the pool, but at least 5 of them have got a broken screen.  I don't use the camera on the phone much. So that was never a factor.I just looked at how I have used the other phones for the last 10 years and counting what made sense for my usage leaving all other things out.

  I Can't even think at any point of time that it's been that easy for me to Back to Android after using Iphone 11.But after using Oppo Find X2 my thoughts were totally blown away by the performance I got. I Just Loved the Build Quality and can’t Even tell u about the display but I can tell u one thing that Oppo Find X2 has the best display in any Smartphone on Planet Earth till today.The way it charges the battery with 65W SuperVooc charger is insane.Let me Tell u About Some Pros first-1.Display Is the Bestest In any Smartphone Ever2.Flawless performance from the best Chipset Inside3.World's Fastest Charging Phone4.Superfast Read n Write Speed through UFS 3.1 storage5. Good Camera not the best needs some Software Upgrades6.Better Haptic Motor as Compared to other flagships7.Best Sound In this Price Range or In Android MarketNow I have To talk about Cons -1. Battery Backup is not upto flagship level but it's not hurt that much because of 65W SuperVooc Charger2.Always got Accidental touches due to It's Curve Display3.Bit Slippery and got Fingerprint on Its back glass4.No Hardcase provided in the Box and the Quality of pre-applied screen protector is bad5.Not a Single Good Quality Screen Protector or Case Found on anywhere till now that's a bit annoying for me .But I highly Recommend to go with this one 😊Oppo Find X2 is real Flagship of 2020

  Display is top notch. Video Streaming is an absolute pleasure using this phone. Ultra Vision Engine and Dolby Atmos stands out.Charging from 0 to 100 in around 45 mins.Photos were good. Videos were far better than I expected . Auto Focussing speed and Stability were the highlights.UI is clean . Color Os is definetely getting better.No heating issues as of now. I got a clear 7 hrs ON-screen time with heavy usage On 120 Hz , Auto Fhd-Qhd . It was just a day of use and I'll update my thoughts after spending more time.EDIT -I have attatched camera samples .After 3 weeks of use -1. Display is one of the best.2. Video streaming- I had one of the best experience using Netflix and Youtube.3. Charging and battery - The battery lasts 7 hrs on heavy usage constantly and can be fully charged under 40 minutes . The battery standby is also good.4. Camera is good and it depends on the individuals use , as to what that person demands from the cam. I had a good experience with it. Front camera was really good and gave decent selfies.I did observe a dynamic range difference when shifting from normal to ultrawide sensor.5. No heating issues during heavy usage and charging . But did observe some while recording video . The regions around the rear cam gets heated up during recording. But that was not much of an issue .6. UI was okayish but could definitely improve. I was using Oneplus 5 for 3 years and shift from oxygen to color OS was observable. One hand mode was of great use .7. The curved edges and design are beautiful . The case sent along with the phone was also good. The charger wires could have been of better quality. (There is also an unavailability of other quality cases for the phone.)8. I had been waiting to buy Oneplus 8 pro but due to its unavailability and display issues , I went for this one and I do not regret about it . Its almost identical to what Oneplus has to offer except for the smaller ultrawide camera sensors and an increase in price by 5k . The price would have been perfect at around 55k-60k.Final Verdict -It depends on the persons preference . If you are a person who would want a premium feel smartphone with excellent display, video streming experience , good design, good camera setup and fast charging : Go for this one . It would definitely win your hearts - a quality product from Oppo.

  Read about the products reviews everywhere from youtube to news articles. Initially, little sceptical to invest 65K on oppo. But after product delivered, my overall experience with oppo totally changed.I was aware that oneplus is manufactured by oppo, hence quality & durability never a barrier. Oneplus marketed in online & Oppo in offline that’s the difference, rest everything is same.Coming to the product – OPPO Find X2It impress me from the 1st impression, which is box of product. They make sure customer feel premium from first look itself, have to admit they invest lot in box.Screen: That’s the main USP of product, I used apple, samsung earlier but find x2 is best of best in terms of screen. Be it 120Hz refresh rate or resolution everything is best. It has eye protection & flicker free screen so now worry about web-series.Charging: 65W charging unbelievable, I never have to wait for charging my phone. Just plug in and you phone is ready for single day. After watching Netflix for 2 hours only 5% battery consumed.Processor: I has best qualcomm 865 processor, just don’t think about slow speed. Its history now.5G enabled: Cherry on the cake, what better can expect from any flagship phone. You don’t have to think for next two year to upgrade the phone.Wifi 6: Never thought wifi version make such a difference in network speed, lag free, never found any delay in opening any page.Overall, this is best phone in the premium segment. Don’t think twice, if you really want to purchase phone not invest on Brand, then go for OPPO Find X2.

  After using almost 1.5 days of this phone. Here I am sharing the pros & cons related to oppo reno 4pro.Pros:1. Design: Its a killer look, definitely gives a premium look (5/5)2. Display: Its awesome 3D edge smooth & bright display looks more premium (5/5)3. Camera: It's good. the front camera is better than the rear. (4/5)4. Sound: Awesome sound while listening & watching movies. You can enjoy 3D Dolby sound, Theater sound. (5/5)5. Battery: Its cool, not draining too fast. The main thing is charging. It's really very fast. (5/5)Cons:1. Sometimes the upper back button is not working due to edge display2. While using dual SIM you cant identify message info (it's for sim 1 or sim 2). Its quit disappointment3. Night flare is not available in selfie camera

  Reno4 pro phone truely feels like a premium phone. The infinity display (edge display or 3d curve) makes this phone stand apart from all the other phones in this price segment.The phone also has a great feel to it when holding (it's really thin).Now coming to the usage part:Display (5/5) - the dispaly is really good I think the 90Hz refresh rate would have a hand in it.Charging (6/5)- the best aspect by far, the 65W charging is really awesome and charges the phone really fast.Sound (5/5) - the sound is really goodCamera (4/5) - camera for this segment is also really good stand alone (maybe a point less as compared to Reno3 pro).This is the intial review or this smartphone, I think it really does justice to the price point.

  At the onset I would like to express how unsatisfied I am as a customerafter purchasing OPPO and the series of instances that have taken placeover the past one week.I am writing this as it happened:After a few days of usage of OPPO Reno 4 Pro, I started facing issues.Issues pertaining to lag while using Google Chrome, Generic apps andswitching between multiple tabs, I was completely unhappy with the productand I could clearly see the lack in  performance. When I flagged the issueon the 12th evening to Amazon services, an online tech diagnostic processwas initiated and later I was informed about a technician visiting mylocation/ residence on the 14th afternoon. (I was told that the returnwindow shall be extended for further 10 days as the product is beinginspected)When I tried reaching out to the technician, my calls were unanswered ( 6to be precise) and later that afternoon one of the tech representativecalls to inform me that the technician will not be  visiting and ifenquired by Amazon, I was requested to say that the visit was successfuland promised a refund process.Again after one day of no response, I made an effort to reach out to Amazonand explain the entire issue and now is where the Amazon agent clearlydenies to take any responsibility for after sale customer service anddiverts me to get in touch with OPPO directly. After numerous calls to OPPOand with no response from their end I had no place to go but to come backto you.After a long call with the amazon tech team, the young lady understands howunhappy I am as a customer using a phone that's a downgrade and going toand fro resolving this. As a protocall she assigns a technician visitagain. As per the technician who did visit, agreed that there is lag in theusage but that's OPPO for you and signs off saying he'll have to resolvethe ticket, booking this under working fine.This is the entire narration of a series of events over the last 10 days.Here's how I feel.Absolutely Unhappy, first with Amazon having to reachout to express andexplain about my current status and give a download of a series of eventsthat's happened every time over a call again and again, Secondly usingOPPO, with its performance, Pathetic.It has taken a lot of mental stress going to and fro on this purchase withthe customer care.*I would request Amazon for a refund (within Amazon wallet) for thisproduct* as it's within the Return window : 12-Aug 2020, Later extended 10 days and I don't want to invest any further time on this.As I end, I would like to ask Amazon just one thing.WHAT IS MORE IMPORTANT ? HAPPY SATISFIED CUSTOMERS or THE POLICIES ?Thanks

  Phone look feel and charging are among the great features. Charging is super fast compared to any other phone in the market. However considering the price and features claimed by Oppo, the Processor is slow also 4000 MaH battery is bit less compared to the specs. Overall a premium mid segment phone is you can hike your budget just a bit you can get a SD 865 processor phone which is much faster

  After using the all new Samsung Galaxy A30s, i truly found that this is a nice little budget phone for day to day consumers. It has got a decent battery backup, display's amazing (first time using an AMOLED display), the triple camera setup is quite useful and has good color reproduction but it somehow cannot try to get a good shot at night. I mean the pictures are not so bad, but there is definitely some tuning required to make the camera take good shots at night. The fingerprint reader is very fast but be careful to use a certified and original screen guards or protectors as the fingerprint does struggle in screen guards. The back glass design is just awfull. It shines out real hard at bright lights. Included accessories are a pretty decent specially the included fast charger with the Type-C cable pretty sturdy. Overall this phone is a good competitor against chinese manufacturers.PROS:--Supports fast charge and has pretty decent charge rates-Has NFC which enables in wireless payments and support for Android Beam (unless Android 10 comes)-Has a good 4000mAh battery, pretty decent for bit of heavy users-Has on-screen fingerprint which is good-Camera setup is goodCONS:--Camera struggles to shoot better pictures at night-The included night mode requires a little bit software upgrade-OneUI which is extremely good, but the icons are kind of kiddish-And mostly- Where is Bixby voice assistant?There is bixby home though but this phone does not support Bixby voice assistantOverall the cons are not a big factor.Most of the cons are fixable by latter FOTA upgradesSo if you are looking for a budget option, go for itThis is my review after using the A30s for 3 months. Firstly speaking, samsung claims to have a 4000mAh battery, which sounds good but use it and you will feel that it is not actually keeping the charge for the required hoped time. I mean, typically a 4000mAh battery should last for 1 and a half day easily. But in this, it hardly manages to go through a day. I had to dip the phone in the charger atleast two to three times a day. And strictly speaking, i don't play heavy games like PUBG or COD. I am just a day to day user. But you cant complain if the phone charges in 45 mins. Another thing i want to mention, please keep a 4D tempered glass screen protector otherwise a single hard drop in that AMOLED screen will cause a good beautiful crack in the screen. Also i feel like the speaker of this phone is not upto the mark. Like, i've used budget phones like realme 3, Asus zenfone max pro m1, Asus max pro m2, redmi 7a.All of them had such beautifull sounding speakers. Compared to those, it is nothing sort of. Also, the fingerprint get's slow as you use it. It feels very slow. But despite all of these, samsung strictly gets a plus mark for it's awesome update schedule. And yeah, one ui holds my favourite ui spot still. And one more thing to say to all those who had bought it and also those who are going to buy it. If you feel like the glass back design looks just awesome(specially black one), just go ahead and fall in love with that design!!

Most loved part in this phone is fast charging ♥️🔥✌️. And missed one part that is it's mobile security when you try to turn off ur mobile it asks for a pin or fingerprint....... just think ur mobile got stolen or lost.. if someone tries to turn off it won't coz it asks pin that's impossible for thief to crack it♥️🔥🔥🔥

  Brought this phone for my wife who is die hard fan for oppo...Offer like 2000 extra off on exchange with Oppo is just like waww....So after exchange of her old oppo mobile I got this phone for just Rs.6800.... Best phone if u want oppo brand name and u are boared to ur old oppo phone... So this review is considering 6800 cost...Pros.1) good features considering cost 6800.2) Size matters 6.5 inch grt3) Speakers are good Dolby4) Comes with classic headphones with good looks and decent sound quality... No other phones now a days comes with headphones...5) Quad camera gives good quality photos...6) Selfie camera is also decent considering cost 68007) 5000mAh battery8) can be use as power bank for other phonesCons:1) Original cost 13990 is huge considering features...Other good brands like MI, VIVO, MOTO, etc sells 48MP camera phones for 12000 and so...2) Accessories like back cover, tempered glass are yet not in market... May be u have to wait for them...Though 1 transparent back cover is included in Mobile Box...This is all about this phone after 24hrs use....I will update if something comes...

  Best option for exchange, I got it in 9k ,Review score (out of 5)Design : 4.5 (finger print scanner position is bit high), other things like screen size, corners,back panel, camera position are perfect and it's light weight too...Sounds quality : 5/5 (unexpected, dual side stereo and Dolby is awesome, loudness, clarity and effects are far better then any other phone i.e. mi 7 pro, Lenovo, Samsung or honor)Photography : it's similar to other available options in market, day light as usual is very clear and crisp, didn't get time for more night photography, but few repetitive uploaded pics are in night mode with very minimal light which are good.Battery backup : best in this category (10% ~ 3 hours of heavy uses) , for heavy uses 30hours for normal uses it ll go up to 2 days.Performance : not played many games but seems good, while opening any game auto memory cleaner will run,lag and heat issue is not there (checked continuously 1.5 hours)Memory space : 46 GB free space, all basic apps are pre installed, separate as card slot is available (apart from 2 SIM slot), 1.86 GB ram available after all updation, while playing any game also 900 to 1 GB space is availablePros : apart from above mentioned points :1)Front cam is good like other similar phone (mi, real me, honor, Samsung)2) earphones quality/look is very good in this range.3) dual speaker position is in front top of display and near to charging pin, so stereo comes properly4)face detection is fast5)no heating issue while charging /YouTube /gaming6) battery is lasting for more than 4 days on normal usesCons:1) fingerprint scanner position is bit high2) ram 6 GB would have a perfect option3) macro photos are not that good compare to redmi 7 pro4) no fast charger with pack

  Chose this mobile because few others were having later delivery and our area was to go in for lockdown.Prime very fast delivery. Kudos to Amazon.About the mobile it's a good piece. But better to go for the 6 GB ram variant.Selfie camera outperforms the primary camera which is according to the specs.Overall a good decent mobile at the price point, considering all aspects.Pros at this price1. 6.5 inch full hd is good2. 128 GB internal memoryCons at this price1. Primary camera is actually bad2. 4gb ram, can't multitask.3. Snapdragon older.

  This review's to all those who were eagerly waiting for the phone to launch and get hands on, but before all it's always hard to get the ""DEMO"" at the earliest so.. ""IMAGES"" above are to those who can't find demos much often/needed color/to avoid contacts at stores during Covid.Pros - Leather back warmth feelCons - Back Camera's not upto the mark when compared to the phones in market and of this price range, though it has given a sleek and leather finish with minimized thickness. . It's pro fades out its Con so can go for it blindly but only if you think ""CAMERA'S"" not your ""PRIORITY""Features I thought would be there was 9.1 surround music/Dolby Atmos but it comes with:Real Sound Technology, just have a look into it if you're specific2. Super Amoled+ Display.Hassle free(Inside the box):Tempered glass comes on the phone itself so no extra work on fixing, which might sometimes go wrong.2. Silicon back case (if you're looking for touch and feel of leather back, better not use.. but use a side bumper if available for protection) Do also post where we can find side bumper, cos it's hard finding for new phones.. Thanks!Looking for a Standout design in 15-20k range? Then, ""GO FOR IT"" that's Value for money!

  Hi, I am writing this review after 3 days of usage1. Firstly thanks to Amazon. Got delivered at a lightning speed. Ordered ok Saturday. Launch date was on 21st September and got delivered the same day at morning.2. Now about Oppo 17, this is very light weight, speed is good, I ordered dynamic orange. Trust me, this is the best and attractive colour I found ।l, blue is a good option too if you don't like a funky coloir।3. Camera I did not found upto the mark . Night mode is not that great but yes if you are a selfie person, go for it. I was using Ralme Xt earlier and it's camera was much better. But ok I will manage . I am a part time photographer and often I use my phone to click pics. Realme supported me a lot. Let's see how much Oppo supports.4. Speed is good. 6 GB 128 GB. Good combo. No lagging till now. Going smooth.5. Touch is awesome. Phone gets unlocks quickly. No lagging here too .Rest I will use for some more days and come back with my reviews again.

  i like the camera quality, images and videos are sharp and clear. there is a wee bit of noise in low light areas but it can be overlooked.it looks quite a bit like the iphone X but is largerdisplay is on par with iphone xmusic sounded as good as iphone xi could just unbox and get on with it as oppo provided the tempered glass, back cover as well. which was a pleasant surprise as I was not expecting. 😄Also the design, finger print sensor on display, face recognition .... lot of features.dual 4G standy by with an SD card is a blessing and I was looking for exactly what this phone offered at the right price and also the back cover made  of leather is so freaking rich and classy.quite happy with what I got. This is probably the fastest decision I have ever taken around buying a phone and I am hoping this will last long, like most of my other phones.

  So it's been three days since I'm using this phone and I'm completely in love with it at the price I got.1. Weight of the Phone is very less when compared to any phone in this segment and this matters a lot to me while carrying or casual music listening or any stuff.2. Back leather type wrapper is really good and gives a premium feel.3. UI is also good in terms of usage and mobile handling and compatibility4. Camera is decent for video calls/ normal phots not that great especially for shotting long-distance objects/ sceneries. But this doesn't matter to me a lot. Come on use a professional camera if you want photography at peaks.5. Design is excellent and it is the slimmest phone at 7.43mm6. Build Material quality is good.7. Sound is good but not that great for melodies or any songs please use earphones/headphones.8. Display is really good and it's out of my expectation as I'm using Samsung AMOLED previously.9. Processor is fast for general purpose and played COD and some other games at medium graphics didn't observe any lag.10. Battery is okay and keeps you charged up for one day (General usage with low- medium gaming)11. Software is fast and no clutter apps or extra apps.Overall I would definitely recommend if someone wants a nice phone for general usage which looks classy.

  Go for it. Undoubtedly the best mobile of 2019 so far.Pros - 1. Camera - A+(Specially selfie camera with AI technology, where you will find features like face slim, nose slim, chin slim, 3D , bigger eyes and others. I bet you will like it, much better than Vivo)  2. Internal memory and Ram - A++  3. Build quality - A+  4. Battery - A+ (holding charge including heavy usage and game play till 2 days easily)  5. Charging - A+.Some says it doesn't support fast charging but it is neither a normal or slow charging. It's not a super fast charging but a good fast charging.  6. Sound - A++ in one word awesome. Sound comes as 3D surround sound type. Previously I used small speakers whenever I used to see movies on Amazon prime even in my iPhone. But now no need of speakers. Superb Dolby digital sound quality.Cons - Only the display quality but it is negligible.

  This is best thing you can get at this price from a reputed brand with Made in India tag. First time I ordered on the first day of online launch and am happy. I'm writing after few days of usage, but this should not be different as my experience with Samsung has been most consistent as compared to other mobile brands I've used earlier.Good:- Android 10! Beautiful looks! Finally I can delete SMS from notification now!!- Display is excellent with Blue light filter.- Performance is good. No heating or lagging. Real Racing worked fine.- 6000 Mah battery is BIG- 128 GB storage is pretty good. 512 GB card supported with dedicated external card slot.- Both dedicated sim slots support LTE- Fast charging and 15W charger top with phone. The phone came with 0% charge. Charged fast.- Mobile speakers sound is good, but I prefer external speakers for better bass in music.- Camera is really good. Macro performance is very good - look at skin in tatoo photo and dust perticles in deskphone photo!! (photos of M31 are from other phone). Both front and rear camera support FHD video 3840x2160. I may not require to carry my DSLR everyehere.- Face unlock / figure-print sensor response is good- Received next day by 11 AM !Not So Good:- Not that thin, but ok.- Doesn't have Samsung Dex- Started to Boot Screen!! Gave me a little shock but selected reboot option and then every thing was smooth. An Android Updated (other than many application updates which is normal in any case) appeared on within days of launch. But update was smooth. No issue at all.- Feels delicate in hand but a Rs.49 cover was good enough. Wrongly ordered black while the set is blue. Just 49 so will reorder the blue one as well :)- Called Samsung Store, but no information with them about availability date. Still no call from them.Feedback- Feels good in hand and in use. It is a powerhouse and you feel it.- Will update after few days of use, but don't have any doubt as of now.Go for it without any doubt.

  Lets just begin with the obvious. This phone's quality doesn't meet the claims made.Cons:1. Camera Quality: Picture quality is just awful. Its worse than a 8MP camera. The pixelization is obvious and it is definitely not a 64MP camera. Do not believe the claims Samsung might make. The quad camera is of no use as the macro camera reminds me of the decade when VGA cameras were common.2. Battery: Samsung may claim the battery will last for two days but it didnt last that long - no Netflix, Prime Video, heavy games being used. So that makes two of the biggest features useless.3. Amazon's Policy: In case you don't like the phone, Amazon has made sure you are stuck with it. The switch from 10 day ""return"" policy to 10 day ""replacement"" policy is dowright wrong! Hold onto the shutters physical mobile stores - your days are not over yet. When you do request for replacement, there is an inspection of the phone at buyer's site - which I understand but the fact that replacement will occur almost on the 10th day from my purchase still keeps me at unease.Pros:1. Display: The screen quality is good and has adjustment options for warm light and cold light.2. Performance: Streaming videos and playing heavy games was smooth for the first 4 days but then again Samsung is known for fast deterioration of performance, so I will keep my eyes and ears open.3. Sound: Speaker quality is okay but not upto the mark. In a noisy place you fail to hear the crispness and the boom.

  I am using it from 3 days , 6000 mah battery is just for name only, it work for 1-1.25 days only with moderate usage.64mp camera doesn't support zoom, camera doesn't support 60fps video recording.Build quality is not good, plastic back with lots of figure prints in few minutes handling, not look new in few seconds.Face unlock very slow.Heat issue which charging and heavy usageFull charge takes more than 3 hrsWould not recommend to buy , if you are looking  for good camera phonego with other brands like oppo or redmi , giving much better quality

  The phone was wrapped in dust. Although it was seal packed, still many dust were on screen and back side. It shows security concerns and Amazon, Samsung and seller must draw its attention. How dust can be reached in seal packed box? Now I'm lacking trust in Amazon,Samsung and seller. Either my phone was used or its components might have replaced, as in brand new phone,there exists no dusts because they are built in factory, but here shows how they are playing with the customer and their product.Phone is nice, large battery backup of more than 2 days, 6.4 display is big, camera is perfect and 6GB ram is enough for daily usage. All things are good. No heating issue.However my only concern is ""dust"" and how it came there if its brand new.So I could give 5 star,but now 1 is enough.Beware of Amazon,Samsung and seller.

  Not a Samsung performance. It seems it was launched without proper test n trials. I already had M30 so decided to buy M31 (6GB). But got shocked to see the poor performance n battery life. The 64MP images can't be sent easily to someone on WhatsApp. Camera give errors now n then. Battery life worst then M30 which has 5000mh. Mobile heats on charging.

  Go for it. Undoubtedly the best mobile of 2019 so far.Pros - 1. Camera - A+(Specially selfie camera with AI technology, where you will find features like face slim, nose slim, chin slim, 3D , bigger eyes and others. I bet you will like it, much better than Vivo)  2. Internal memory and Ram - A++  3. Build quality - A+  4. Battery - A+ (holding charge including heavy usage and game play till 2 days easily)  5. Charging - A+.Some says it doesn't support fast charging but it is neither a normal or slow charging. It's not a super fast charging but a good fast charging.  6. Sound - A++ in one word awesome. Sound comes as 3D surround sound type. Previously I used small speakers whenever I used to see movies on Amazon prime even in my iPhone. But now no need of speakers. Superb Dolby digital sound quality.Cons - Only the display quality but it is negligible.

  I decided to finally upgrade my phone after 2 years. After lots of research with around 30K budget initially i wanted to go for K20 Pro but have been using MI phones for last 4 years so it seemed only hardware upgrade with everything feeling same. After research i finally decided to buy this phone and after inital 2 hours of usage it looks awesome. I am not a gamer and focussed on mainly camera & storage and its totally worth it. I will give detailed feedback after using it for sometime. Also thanks to amzon for quick delivery.3k discount was the highlight since 30K looks slightly on expensive side. I already have started liking Color OS over MIUI.  Case you get with this phone is very premium. Earphone quality is also too good. Clicked few photo samples and it's more than what i had expected. Glad that i bought this phone .

  The phone arrived today.There is a considerable amount of bloatware - MI apps/junk.The build quality is medium - mostly plastic.The camera is also not bad but it blurs and does applies beautify filters, which I am sure I don't like, have to turn this off, or the pictures look unnatural.The display seems to be crisp enough, and the phone itself is pretty snappy (right now).Call quality is crisp, I don't have VoLTE in my locality though.The Green and Greener look is nice.The phone charges really fast.Like I mentioned earlier, the phone arrived today, so I am not sure how the phone will age.There are other good phones in this category that offer very much the same, for instance the Moto One Power, which would definitely have less bloatware.Overall, considering this is a phone that will be used moderately - It is not bad.Except for the bloatware!

  Hi guys,In general the phone is nice and does manages to provide you the feeling of a premium phone. However there are some flaws which I witnessed over my experience till date. So let me provide you the Pros and Cons of the phone -PROS...1. Nice built quality and comfortable to hold.2. Excellent performance.3. Symmetric stereo speakers. (Better experience while watching videos or playing games)4. Nice camera with with very good quality low light or night photography which still many flagship phones lack.5. Up to the mark 90Hz refresh rate display.6. Amoled screen brightness is excellent and there is no issue in viewing display even while the display is directly facing towards the sun.7. Excellent charging with 30 watts wired and wireless charging. I tried charging the phone from dead 0 to 100 and achieved it just under 1 hour. (In my personal opinion I don't think higher charging wattage like 65 watts is good for phone battery and sounds like a gimmick as even though they have double the wattage they usually charge a phone of smaller battery about 4000 mAH in about 40 minutes which is not much of a difference. )8. Super steady video from rear camera because of presence of both EIS & OIS.9.Bigger battery 4780 mAH as compared to other flagship phones.10. Doesn't misses out on any feature like reverse wireless charging, 5g support (though in India not of use for at least couple of years), NFC, Dual GPS, capable of being connected to wifi and provide Hotspot simultaneously, No MIUI ads till date.CONS...1. The limitation of resolution of the screen FHD+. The bigger size of the screen results in lower ppi and thus stands nowhere near QHD+ displays.2. This phone comes with Global MIUI 11 and has Google dialer and messaging app thus misses out features like call recording, phone notes etc. (Reason being in many countries like UAE it is illegal to have call recording apps or VPN apps. )3. Trust me this MIUI has a lot of bugs and thus results in issues like while using finger print scanner, the device heats up at times even during normal usage, but the overall performance is acceptable. (Hopefully most of the issues will be resolved by MIUI 12 update which is going to be available soon)4. Outdated front camera and supporting rear cameras hardware. (The 20 MP front camera and that too without EIS, 2 MP macro camera, 2 MP depth camera and 13 MP ultrawide camera seems like a joke for a 2020 flagship phone with the price of 50k.)5. The battery is bigger compared to many devices but looses about 10 to 20% even when left untouched overnight thus I'd say not so good battery management.6. Misses out a 3.5 mm Jack and also the c type to 3.5 mm Jack converter provided in the box doesn't seem to be of a very good quality as per my initial impression.7. Though the low light photography is good but daylight photography is not that exceptional as one might expect from 108 MP camera.8. I felt that the call quality is not up to the mark. (Maybe just in my case)Pricing issues - Though there are two things which have gone against Xiaomi as well as other Mobile brands1) Increment in GST rates from 12% to 18%2) Higher import duties for imported phones.I think that the phone is slightly overpriced at 50k but if we compare it with it`s biggest competitor the One plus 8 I will always choose MI 10 as so many things are missing in One plus 8 (like wireless charging, LP DDR RAM 4x is present instead of 5, comes with smaller battery 4300mAH and Sony IMX 586 Camera sensor which is quite outdated now) and have a price difference of only 5k.  Even that can be narrowed down by using bank offers if available which was there in my case. However in comparison with One plus 8 pro I feel that MI 10 is slightly behind because of the MIUI bugs related flaws, FHD+ display and outdated secondary camera hardware (including front camera. Thus I believe that if the aforementioned issues would have been addressed by Xiaomi I would have considered this phone justifying the price completely and without a doubt would have been the best phone ever under 50k. However in reality still the phone is definitely a strong competitor in the flagship mobile segment.

  Hi guys,In general the phone is nice and does manages to provide you the feeling of a premium phone. However there are some flaws which I witnessed over my experience till date. So let me provide you the Pros and Cons of the phone -PROS...1. Nice built quality and comfortable to hold.2. Excellent performance.3. Symmetric stereo speakers. (Better experience while watching videos or playing games)4. Nice camera with with very good quality low light or night photography which still many flagship phones lack.5. Up to the mark 90Hz refresh rate display.6. Amoled screen brightness is excellent and there is no issue in viewing display even while the display is directly facing towards the sun.7. Excellent charging with 30 watts wired and wireless charging. I tried charging the phone from dead 0 to 100 and achieved it just under 1 hour. (In my personal opinion I don't think higher charging wattage like 65 watts is good for phone battery and sounds like a gimmick as even though they have double the wattage they usually charge a phone of smaller battery about 4000 mAH in about 40 minutes which is not much of a difference. )8. Super steady video from rear camera because of presence of both EIS & OIS.9.Bigger battery 4780 mAH as compared to other flagship phones.10. Doesn't misses out on any feature like reverse wireless charging, 5g support (though in India not of use for at least couple of years), NFC, Dual GPS, capable of being connected to wifi and provide Hotspot simultaneously, No MIUI ads till date.CONS...1. The limitation of resolution of the screen FHD+. The bigger size of the screen results in lower ppi and thus stands nowhere near QHD+ displays.2. This phone comes with Global MIUI 11 and has Google dialer and messaging app thus misses out features like call recording, phone notes etc. (Reason being in many countries like UAE it is illegal to have call recording apps or VPN apps. )3. Trust me this MIUI has a lot of bugs and thus results in issues like while using finger print scanner, the device heats up at times even during normal usage, but the overall performance is acceptable. (Hopefully most of the issues will be resolved by MIUI 12 update which is going to be available soon)4. Outdated front camera and supporting rear cameras hardware. (The 20 MP front camera and that too without EIS, 2 MP macro camera, 2 MP depth camera and 13 MP ultrawide camera seems like a joke for a 2020 flagship phone with the price of 50k.)5. The battery is bigger compared to many devices but looses about 10 to 20% even when left untouched overnight thus I'd say not so good battery management.6. Misses out a 3.5 mm Jack and also the c type to 3.5 mm Jack converter provided in the box doesn't seem to be of a very good quality as per my initial impression.7. Though the low light photography is good but daylight photography is not that exceptional as one might expect from 108 MP camera.8. I felt that the call quality is not up to the mark. (Maybe just in my case)Pricing issues - Though there are two things which have gone against Xiaomi as well as other Mobile brands1) Increment in GST rates from 12% to 18%2) Higher import duties for imported phones.I think that the phone is slightly overpriced at 50k but if we compare it with it`s biggest competitor the One plus 8 I will always choose MI 10 as so many things are missing in One plus 8 (like wireless charging, LP DDR RAM 4x is present instead of 5, comes with smaller battery 4300mAH and Sony IMX 586 Camera sensor which is quite outdated now) and have a price difference of only 5k.  Even that can be narrowed down by using bank offers if available which was there in my case. However in comparison with One plus 8 pro I feel that MI 10 is slightly behind because of the MIUI bugs related flaws, FHD+ display and outdated secondary camera hardware (including front camera. Thus I believe that if the aforementioned issues would have been addressed by Xiaomi I would have considered this phone justifying the price completely and without a doubt would have been the best phone ever under 50k. However in reality still the phone is definitely a strong competitor in the flagship mobile segment.

  At first glance it looks a bit bulky. Camera, display etc. are satisfactory. Overall GOOD non Chinese phone.However, for their improvement, I tried to give some critical feedback to the company over phone but it was not so easy, so, I am writing here sothat Samsung India can take this critical review for their improvement.Battery:Battery is 7K mha but it is draining so fast that its overall backup time is slightly better than any other average phone.User Interface:User interface needs tremendous improvement. You can't take screenshot easily. You need to learn fine motor coordination between your fingers and power&volume button with microsecond precision. After three days I discovered taking screenshot by swapping screen. But this easy method for taking screenshot is not easy to find in its setting section. Automatic redial isn't available. also in setting section, searching for basic operation like redial, call waiting etc are either missing or very difficult to access. UI should be more intelligent and intuitive. Call recording should take permission from user before it starts recording any call.Dolby Sound:Dolby sound effect is excellent but its available only for external speaker. Inbuilt speaker don't have Dolby effect. You hv to buy headphone or external speaker for experiencing Dolby sound effect. Its Dolby software is so impressive that its work on a cheapest headphone but Samsung's own inbuilt speaker doesn't.External Outlook:Read somewhere that this phone has 3D prism like glastic body. GLASTIC seems to be a discovery of new material (Glass+Plastic) because its looks transparent and shining. But in reality, its a cheap looking smooth and slippery plastic back body. Also, Its prone to scratches neither its water resistant. Sometimes it generates heat. In this price segment, Samsung can easily provide metallic back for better appearance and transfer of heat.Overall, its good non chini phone with good camera and display, a bit bulky, satisfactory speed, scope of tremendous improvement in UI and setting, and bit overpriced.

  Cons:_OverpricedBattery drain only fast in normal  uses give only  24 hours  backup.Sound quality  is so soBuild quality  is not goodPros:_Good processorGood  cameraUser interface  is goodFinger print sensor  working  very fast but some times missed out.After six days of uses, impressed  with camera performance, Display, fingerprint  working, and processor.Disappointed  with Battery  performance  my brother  realme 2 giving easily 2days battery  backup with 4250mah, but this phone is horrible in battery  backup  only  24 hours  with 7000. I have  doubt  its not 7000 man battery its like 2000 or 2500mah. Heating  issue also faced during  charging.

  Genuine Feedback to samsung and all buyersNot Upto the Mark..Battery is good, but mobile is very heavy.. not handy for one hand operation.. if you use it continuously then you feel pain in your  hand, designed is out dated, poor quality material.. camera is just okay..I am not happy overall performance of this phone at this price band...Mobile should be perfect for 15-16k price band..Lookwise not goodDisplay qaulity is just good not bestSound quality is goodCamera not much good that I am expecting.Big screen which perfect for movie watcher.. but after 30 minutes you feel pain in your hands.I bought Electric blue colour, it's look like samsung old samrt phone .My request to Amazon, is it possible to return this mobile. Then help me for return...I am not happy with overall performance of the phone...

  Ok so here comes the first review of this phone. Ordered on the first day of its sale and received on 3rd day. Indeed its a big and bulky phn but easy to handle. Few highlights:1. Seamless fingerprint scanner. I hv heard tht recent samsung phns have ths issue , however i dnt see any in ths phn. Its as gud as my past phns Asus 6z and Vivo v15pro. Side fingerprint scanner on the power button really makes it stylish and too easy to handle as well.2. Camera quality is really gud wth many features which luks tempting which im yet to explore. Even in dim light it scores quite well. Have all latest features like slow mo, 10x zoom, focus lens, panorma view and other added features.3. Battery ofcourse was the highlight while buying ths phn. I received this phn at 43%. And even after a rigorous 3 hr session of data transfer and apps installation it still holds at 33%. I believe it gonna last 2 days easily wth heavy net usage , mild games and gud 2 hrs of talk time.4. Luks wise it does seem premium despite a plastic back.5. Wonderful touch and a decent processimg speed. I tried playing 7-8 apps at the same time and it never hanged or lagged despite 50% memory up. Yet to try on heavy games though.6. Front cam does spoil the fun while watching full screen videos, like a small black dot bt can be lived wth.7. No headphones in the box.8. C to C charging cable capable of reverse charging too.Overall i wld rate it 4/5. Its one of the best non chinese phn available in the market for those who r luking for a huge battery wth a decent cam and light gaming purpose.Wld update on battery and cam after few days of usage

  There's something wrong with the new Samsung M51 mobile. Many other users are also facing the same issue. We are unable to connect through Wi-Fi on Samsung M51.Meanest Monster Ever ... HahahahaThis meanest monster is performing poorly within 5 min of unboxing. My eight yr old Lenovo still works like charm with Wi-Fi.Issue: When you trying connecting through Wi-Fi, on giving correct password, it says ""Incorrect Password"".I have done every troubleshooting step suggested by Samsung Tech support:1. Forget the connection and reconnect again.2. Update the phone s/w to latest version.3. Reset Settings4. Reset Network Settings5. Factory Data ResetI have applied every step suggested by tech-support and the result is still the same.The most irritating thing is how can a company like Samsung mess-up such a basic feature & to the surprise, even the tech support has now run out of troubleshooting solutions.Instead of replacing it with new phone, tech support has now told me to get the hardware fixed from Samsung Service centre. I don't get it why should I take a brand new phone to service center & get it opened. Instead a replacement of this phone should be there, I have not even used it for more than an hour.Last year I ordered an MI phone from Flipkart, the battery was getting drained very fast. Within the next day, the phone was replaced without questions asked.Dissappointed by Amazon, the way they are handling this issue.Don't spend your hard-earned money on this phone. Unfortunately, if your phone turns-out to be faulty, then there is a never ending process to take care of issue.

  After using for more than 2 day's I must say, snapdragon 730g works wonderful .CAMERA.This time M series did a honest job by giving us a INTELLI camera of 64 mega Pixcel and more feature in selfie camera.DISPLAY & FINGERPRINT.With Samsung SuperAmoled display you can truly trust the amazing view angle. Now in M51 feature of Widevine L Certification you can enjoy all those global Dolby theatre experience. I found it reliable for my 1920p to 4k level of movie watching without any distraction due to Infinite O display which gives Full Screen Ratio. Fingerprint on side is much faster than I expected. It doesn't takes a second also to open. Even FaceUnlock is faster.Superior, as it matches any S series flagship premium in classy look, strong built for this budget amount. 6.7 inches display is good to handle as it is well managed for one hand use also.

  I am giving this review after spending 20 days with this Phone. I am a retail user and after 6 year of redmi and realme user now buy the Samsung just because of Samsung+Snapdragon and very much dispointed. Here are some Pros and Cons which will help other user like me to decide whether they will buy it or not.Cons :1. No Haptic Feedback2. Low sound quality speaker at Rs 25K3. No apps lock features inbuilt4. No Case Cover in Box5. Plain Plastic back design at 25K which attract too much scratches.6. Samsung trusted Knox security not fully enable on this phone i.e no secure folder option.7. When Sealed Package open then phone display contain so much dust. Not expected the packaging like this from brand like Samsung.8. Gorila Glass 3 protection under 25k i.e out dated glass protection after using 2 days with full care i got one scratch mark on display.9. NFC given but Samsung Pay not there in this phone.10. Audio output in my boat rockers bluetooth headset with this phone is not as much as lound as compare to my previous phone Redmi Note 7 pro.11. Without using phone it take 2 hour to charge but when you use it frequently then it take 2.30-3 hour to charged it full from 0-100%.12. Full battery drained in 12 hour with non stop used including youtube, whatsapp Facebook, messaging, etc except game.13. No Carrier aggregation: Using Jio sim in Samsung M51 and realme X2 pro and both contain different net speed in which Samsung giving me 5mbps and realme x2 pro giving me 9-10mbps.14. Calling issue: while talking through ear piece on call, the person can hear my voice clearly. But if i put the call on loudspeaker, the receiver of call cant hear my voice or he hear my sound very low. Turning back to earpiece the person is able to hear me again.15. Camera Zoom quality is not good. When you focus on Sky whole pic turn into blue. i.e saturation level is too much high in this phone (Image attached).16. While watching movie video in this phone or playing video in youtube brightness fluctuate fast too much automatically i.e Adaptive Brightness issue.Pros :1. Super amoled plus display2. Camera quality Good3. 7000 Mah battery4. Till now Ram management is goodTo much hype created every where for this phone and due to this many user like me has purchased this phone but this phone under 25k is really not value for money. I am going to resale this phone. There are so many phone below 25k with best facilities as compare to this Samsung m51.Conclusion : Phone is overpriced and performance is average

  This is a perfect mobile for you,1. If you properly read the spec before buying this mobile2. If you don't expect all iPhone features in this mobile,3. if you are not a addictive gamer,4. If you don't expect your mobile to be a speaker,5. If you do concern about your data handled in Chinese mobiles,6. If you need better SAR value,7. If your first preference is battery, and decent level of camera quality,8. If you need all trending features to be covered in non Chinese mobile,THEN GO FOR IT... ALSO TRY TO UPDATE TO LATEST SOFTWARE ONCE AFTER SETTING UP YOUR MOBILE, OTHERWISE HEATING ISSUE WILL BE THERE.

  It has issue with camera in night mode and pro mode.It seems like there is dust present on camera sensor which is only visible in dark photos. When photo is clicked with lens covered completely,  it shows hundreds of white spots in image, same happens with pro mode too. (This is not regular image noise)

Display width is too small( Feels like 5"" display)6. Cameras don't have clarity7. 4g signal is weak8. Mentioned made in India but says frequently used apps as alipay, qq, etc., which are Chinese apps9. Tried to get replacement using smartchk app but it responds like a Chinese electronic voting machine(Votes for Redmi:Says mobile works well)10. So no replacements if mobile has quality issues!!!!Worth only half the price .ie. ₹4500/- only, since we have to get adjusted to low quality...

  I got this product and face below issue in 4 days.1) Couple of times the Phone gives a ECHO to the Listener on the other end and couple of time to me also.2) The charger get hot when you keep it on charging.Other issues.1) I was using Asus Zenphone2 of 2015 Model with same ram and Internal Memory,but this phone is really very slow in loading web pages an even your tube.2) The network keeps on fluctuating.Badluck:I got in the trap of Amazon Policy saying that we cannot get refund , we can only give replacement. I would request all the user to kindly be careful when you are buying the product. Amazon very smartly mention at only one place that you can get only replacement and not refund.So the user has not other option left just to get the product replace.Conclusion for me.I can only pray that the product work atleast for 1 year and the replace product doesn't have the technical issue and i dont have to run behind the service center.I will definitely AVOID buying products from Amazon. Save  my money as I was planning to go for Prime membership.

  Display quality is top notch, overall the quality of the phone is very good. All metal body. Camera is good too. Touch smoothness is amazing. I will definitely recommend to buy this phone.The USB is not type C, it is the old one. This is the only con that i found till now. It has got 2 nano sim slots and a dedicated memory card slot (2+1).Other than the phone, amazon delivery service is a bit let down. It took 6 days to deliver the item from Calcutta to Assam. Whereas last year i bought 2 Redmi Note 4 ( for me and my uncle) from flipkart and mi india website, if you recall, Mi had flash sale every Friday. Hence i bought both handset on different dates. To my surprise i placed the order on Friday and received the item on Sunday on one occasion and Monday on the other occasion, which the shipped through ekart and FedEx respectively. Merely in 2-3 i got my phone. But Amazon's courier service is a total letdown as compared ekart and FedEx.

  The Red color looks tacky. Guess I should have bought black instead. The phone feels somewhat cheap in red to be honest. I understand Xiaomi did not supply headphone with this phone. I also feel they should have not supplied with the cheap *** and flimsy phone case (Its an insult lol).  Why even send it. Its very generous of Xiaomi India !! Thank you so much (If I will spend Rs.600 on a head phone then surely I can spend another 200 on a half decent phone case).The screen is awesome!! So is the battery! User interface is not confusing unlike other brands but I will miss Google Now Launcher which gives lesser mortals feel of stock android (Google stopped providing for newer Android OS). Camera is good.This is my 1st Xiaomi phone and I am somewhat happy (damn you red color) with it. And maybe I had higher expectations on the back panel.

Camera performance is average. Processor SD 625 is aged not the latest (but still good). Battery life is sufficient. SIM ejector pin is too small may get lost (careful!). Has got a notification LED on bottom. Has most of the decent sensors (Compass, Step, Gyro etc.). Has IR Blaster.The phone looks identical to other Redmi phones. The display is the main attraction.Overall performance is average, don't expect huge from this phone at this price segment. Good for average user.

  This is my 4th Xiaomi phone in last 3 yrs and this is the worst one I got. This phone is a mess. I am not sure why Xiaomi is not fixing the issues on this phone. I wasted my money on this. This has got horrible cons like:1. this phone will never show you notificaiton icon at status bar. So basically, you will get a sound or vibration that something app has got a notification but you cant see at the phone screen top status bar which is something a 3rd class phone also shows. So this means you will have either have to slide down the top of screen to check the hidden status bar or foolishly keep sliding and check which App has a notification. Worst experience.2. Screen is sluggish  to navigate, slow one.3. Sound out put is not that good.4. Camera is average.5.MIUI being 9.6 is very disaapointing and not user friendly. I was using redmi note 5 pro and it was far better.  I bought this one just because of smaller size to easily fit into pocket. i am regretting now.Verdict: Better go for redmi note 5 pro and avoid this one atleast.

  Have used for over a month now , it definitely is an improvement over the previous versions, especially the camera. The battery life is decent although could be better but it is backed up by fast charger so charging time has certainly reduced. The Ram and internal.storage as well are higher than what other competitors are offering for a product at this price point. Certainly good value for money.

  Honest review for a Honest Samsung phone. I am writing this review after using M31s for more than half month. And my verdict based on truly improved Samsung M series with my experience & tested after usage only.BUILD QUALITY. Superior, as it matches any S series flagship premium in classy look, strong built for this budget amount. My hand is small but still I found 6.5 inches display is good to handle as it is well managed for one hand use also.DISPLAY & FINGERPRINT.With Samsung SuperAmoled display you can truly trust the amazing view angle. Now in M31s feature of Widevine L Certification you can enjoy all those global Dolby theatre experience. I found it reliable for my 1920p to 4k level of movie watching without any distraction due to Infinite O display which gives Full Screen Ratio. Fingerprint on side is much faster than I expected. It doesn't takes a second also to open. Even FaceUnlock is faster.BATTERY.Main benefit of this midrange M series is it's maasive 6000mAh battery which gave me enough juice for nearly 3 days continuously. Tested.CAMERA.This time M series did a honest job by giving us a INTELLI camera of 64 mwgapixel with Single Take feature. Samsung gives what it advertises. Which made me to stick to Samsung brand. My usage of Camera is high & I found no complaints at all in focusing a shoot. Good color saturated. Well bright night shots. Macro shots r OSM. The depth & clarity of 64 megapixel is more developed in this M31s model. So no complaints.PROCESSOR.After using for more than half month I must say, Exynos 9611 works wonderful liquid speed when it is combined with LPDDR4X RAM technology. I have not faced any lag in PUBG or ASPHALT-9 hight end games, in medium setting which is good for battery saving. So 2.3Ghz speed accomplished. No complaints for the budget spent.SOUND QUALITY.After using for hours I found the Speaker this time Samsung made is much improved with Bass Stereo which was missing earlier. The in-ear delivers your ear the pure Dolby Atmos with clear precision and crystal clear bass effect.Bang for the bucks go for it. Thanks Amazon for Safe delivery.

  Ordered on Prime day, 6th August 12 AM. Received the phone on 8th August.All aspects of the phone is on par or above the next segment.Display is gorgeous.Lookwise it doesn't feel like an M series phone.FP sensor works well although it can store only 3 fingerprints.Camera is overall good. Can't say it's a camera centric phone obviously. However it has some good outputs6000mah battery with 25W fast charging is awesome. (you get reverse charging as well).The only con i felt till now is the exclusion of a phone cover in the box. This might sound silly but I'm one of those guy's who use phone with a cover only to be on the safer side. Just because there is no cover I'm unable to use the phone as my daily driver right now.Come on Samsung. How much will a tpu cover cost for you?? 50Rs??M31s is actually A51 without on screen fp. It has better specs than A51 which retails around 8-9k than M31s which makes this phone one of a kind.The dimensions are also the same as A51. So you can use the same tempered glass but cant use A51 back cover for M31s since it should have the cutout for side mounted fp scanner.Overall a great phone. Value for money I should say. If you are not a heavy gamer this is the best choice around.Will update the review after using the phone for 2 weeks.Till then book your phone and wait for the delivery as it is back-ordered at this moment.

'Single take' shot option really useless.People who r looking for camera please don't buy m31s.All the modes camers pictures are 95%blur mode.perfomance of mobile is not up to expectations.When turns into selife mode really shocked IS IT HD photo or Asian paints colored WALL.REALLY SHOCKED.THIS TIME SAMSUNG DISAPPOINTED.Videos display is also not so effective. Starting of series most of them said not  a gaming mobile.really its not gaming mobile.No samsung pay Nfc,No backcase,l.Rather than spending 20k on m31s supposed to switch another model.Name it as blur mobile.THANKS

  Initial impression after using for one day.1. The display is Gorgeous. Feels like a high end device2. Specs say 6000 MaH battery. Power management is not up to the mark. Without using any power intensive app battery drain is quite pronounced and noticeable.  Hopefully Samsung will release a patch to fix this3.Camera: Impressive.  Good lighting conditions result in beautiful and detailed shots. Struggles a bit during the low light conditions. Overall quite ok for the price.4. Processor: Not the fastest out there  but does the job. Nothing to complain about5. Fingerprint scanner is decent.6. No back case in the box. Will take time to get new case delivered.  Case is necessary as the back panel is quite slippery7. I believe the cost should have around 17K instead of 19.5k...! But if you want a non Chinese phone then this is a good option to consider

  I am using this for last 2-3 days now.This is my review after actually using this pgone in all aspects.Pros -1. Canera - Excellent camera - Good low light photography.  64 Megapixel does uts wor. Inteli Cam is just awesome.2. Display is just Superfine even in direct sunlight it works Excellent.Touch is just Excellent.3. Phone looks really cool in hands.4. Smart pop up feature is also good to have.5. UI is good.6. Speaker sound is good.7. No issues in calls - No call drips using Airtel sim.Overall its very nice experience using this phone.I researched alot before burying this phone and i am happy that i made this choice.Cons -1. Battery doesn't look like 6000 MAH it typically gives 1.5 days backup with single charge which other phone alao gives with relatively less Mah Battery.I was hoping to get little more backup2. Processor  - Could have been better3  No back cover for phone as it is hard to find in a market

  Hi all,From Samsung M31s.Bought it on Amazon Prime day sale. Placed the order by 00:04 of 6th August (Day-1 of the sale) and got it very next day Noon 2pm itself. Kudos Amazon India.Grabbed it for 15,999 with a 2k coupon code and HDFC's 10% discount.But, ordered a Matte Back cover and Matte Temper glass (As it didn't come with the box and also wasn't available near me in Chennai). Delivery date is 18th to 25th Aug which is pathetic. I have to take care my SaM31s like a baby.Small review as per my knowledge -On-hand, its so good. (Earlier was using OnePlus 6) Size wise bit bigger that 1+6 (6.5"")Comparing to Nord, we have Memory card slot - no dependency.While updating the phone on first start, i felt bit heat. But later, it was fine.Charged a 100% and had an extensive usage (not a gamer). Battery lasts more than 36hrs (with Bluetooth earphone at times).Charging happened in 70-75 mins with intermediate usage in between.Earphone Jack available comparing to Nord, better than Bluetooth earphone which consumes charge and needs charge for earphones too.Settings - an ocean of settings, wonderful touch sensor and additional features for lock facilities.But, doesn't have indicator on the front face (which shows if notifications are received)No option to find app usage statistics.Audio - Its so good with clear audio in all needs.Photo - Video : Excellent quality of photos and Videos even in a 3x Zoom. Front camera is bit down.Macro Mode is giving a great pic of Close shots.Has Slowmo, Super slowmo, Hyperlapse, Panaroma.AR zone is pure magical. Different features for Front cam and Back cam.Reverse charging facility is amazing. But the box doesn't have USB - charge cable.Overall - M31s is a price worthy with sooo many options.EDIT : Corning Gorilla Glass 3 is fine,just on 10th day of my purchase, my phone fallen down with less than 1m height (slipped from hand) and display borken 💔Handle with care.

  The volume key has stuck inside the phone, and unable to use it. Its Kind of Bend. I have checked on internet and saw so many similar cases. It has to rectify while manufacturing itself. I have raised case replacement but the process is like painful. Technician will take 5 to 7 working days to visit you to see the issue, once he sends the report to seller then they will proceed for replacement. The whole process takes 20 days approx or even more it seems. Mean while I booked this via No cost EMI offer, Now that also getting affected like once you raise replacement case, the Initial contact with back will be terminated and  for that bank will charge some money it seems. And again new contract will be made for new order or replacement. Even though issue was from seller, customer also need to suffer. Its very Bad!!

  Hi Guys, I would like to share my experience after using this budget phone for almost three weeks.A) The phones looks a bit premium when compared to the price paid and looks stylish. You can use a back cover for extra safety.B) The update of MUI 10 OS after unboxing have made the phone navigation more fluidic and easy to use.C) Touch response over screen is cool and finger print detection takes just fraction of second to unlock or activate any set of commands.D) Face Unlock feature in this price range is really a premium thing we can boast off and it works well without any delay.E) Camera clarity is above average and do justice to the megapixel it claims. The portrait mode adds blur and make a good picture if you are in a well lit environment, or else it simply blurs portion of the space around the subject.F) Though preset ringtones are similar in sounds, the clarity is well good to be noticed even in nosy environment.G) Thankfully the heating issue is completely absent on normal usage of the phone. Anyway gaming for more than 1.5 hours adds a little heat in time.H) Have been using the phone for almost three weeks now and it haven't hanged or crashed even for a single time.I) Have a bunch of MI apps which you may not use and hence its better to disable or uninstall them.J) Battery backup is really good and it will last for 1.5 days on moderate to heavy usage.K) Lacks fast charging feature and hence take almost 2 hours to get fully charged.L) The phone doesn't come with a headset and hence you have to buy it separately.M) In overall a good budget phone with latest features.If my review was really helpful for you in knowing more about the product , please click YES. Thank You

  Mobile is cheap but camera quality is not much good as expected, UI is good .Heating up is a issue with Mi phones so with this phone it's the same, but using back cover can solve this problem and then there will be no difficulty using it.Over all phone is quite good in 7000₹range comparing to other brands .

  Firstly, thank you Amazon for the quick delivery.The iPhone 8 if compared with its predecessors (iPhone 6 / 7) is truly a powerhouse when it comes to performance. The A11 Bionic chip has played an absolute  role in maximising the efficiency of the iPhone 8. As for the battery, it’s always better to turn off the mobile data or Wi-Fi on an iPhone when not in use to make the battery last longer than usual.When it comes to make a choice between an iPhone 8 and an iPhone 8 Plus, I’d personally recommend the 8. The screen size is pretty decent, fits in your pocket well & at the same time the iPhone 8 maintains the essence of an iPhone. However, if you’re into larger phones or photography (Dual Camera & the Portrait Mode), the 8 Plus is a great option. :)The all-glass panel makes the iPhone 8 a bit heavier than the iPhone 7 however, it adds to the style making the device look more premium.Again, the true tone display feature too has played a vital role in viewing the screen. Definitely helps in easing the eyes.I’m not really into photography so wouldn’t comment about the camera but the iPhone cameras have always been the eye candy for almost everyone.I’d also like to thank the seller ‘Worldwide_Store’ for his prompt response to my queries. If you’re hesitant about the other sellers, buy it from the ‘Worldwide_Store’.

  Pathetic experience i spent 52000 rs to purchase this phone. Its been two months and i had to visit twice to the apple store. It doesnt get charged properly. Everytime they update the software and give it back to me and after few days it again doesnt get charged. This is definitely and old or refurbished handset. I feel pathetic that after spending big amount i had to suffer so much. I wil never ever purchase such products from amazon

  This is perhaps the most underrated phone. The specs are great. With iOS 12 update, phone functions smooth. Camera is superb. Although it has a glass back but build quality is pretty rigid. You need a cover for sure since the phone slips. In my opinion, it’s better to spend on iPhone and not worry for next four years than spending on android each year. It’s a known fact that iPhones are more durable than androids. Battery is good, have been using the phone a little over a week, but battery seems promising. With heavy usage of around 6-7 hours in the day I still get 30% remaining by 10 PM.

  Except for the brand, there is nothing great about this phone. Mainly there is hardly any difference between iPhone 6s and this phone. Better choose some good android phone with range of 20-40 thousand instead. Thumbs down to this mobile.

  I purchased this iPhone 8 space grey 64 gb on December 2017. I got it for 57k. I saw the price just now has gone down to 36k so I thought I would write a review about it for almost 2 years of use. Well I got this phone when iPhone X was just introduced but as it was much expensive then I went along with iPhone 8 and I have not been disappointed with my choice. The phone is working in the best possible way as it has been just bought yesterday. Not a single da has I have got any software issues, lag issues, aware issues.. nothing at all. It has been a smooth experience so far and I am looking forward to use it for another 3 years more. ASince I am interested in street photography the camera works pretty good for me.Though the glass back feels very slippery and it is actually but since I always use a back cover so it wasn't an issue for me.I have not used it for much of gaming so I have never faced any heating issues but I do have used it for prolonged period of time and I have not felt any discomfort.One thing which people kind of neglect in iPhone is the earphones provided with the phone.The earphones are of pretty good quality and hence should not be taken for granted. In fact the microphone is pretty awesome to record your music or your songs. it is very sensitive and can record even a whisper.As I use MacBook Air so the interaction with my laptop has been pretty good. All in all I don't regret buying it. As the prices have gone down quite a lot now so if anyone out there wants to get a premium perfect size bezel phone I would recommend iPhone 8. Let me know if there are any specific questions about it.

  Decent packaging and shipping 👍 Upgraded from an iPhone X and I reckon its definitely worth it 😊 Size matters, no pun intended, and you can instantly feel the difference b/w a 5.7 inch screen and a 6.5 inch 🤓 If you have an iPhone X or earlier model, you should definitely consider upgrading. For iPhone XS Max, you are better off waiting for next year model as its touted to undergo some radical changes (5G, USB-C, Touch ID comeback and notch less design perhaps). No 5G in this model but doesn't make a difference, at least in India, as even the 5G spectrum has not been auctioned yet 😝  WiFi performance is better than iPhone X as this model supports 11ax protocol 🤗 And by the way, if you are stuck for choice b/w Gold and Midnight Green, go for Gold and thank me later ✨

  I Love the iPhone Pro Max, purchased from Amazon IN, on Oct 14th 2019. This space grey 64 GB base model was delivered to me on Oct 19th. Here are my objective views about this phone:What I didnt like:1. Obviously the price tag. At Rs. 1,09099.00 is a major deterrent when it comes to decide on buying a phone.2. The base model should certainly begin at 128 GB or higher. 64 GB is not gonna be enough when storing 4K videos.3. Optical zoom in camera is still 2X, where as Android phones already have 5X zooms.Now about what I love in this phone:1. The Camera. That is the main reason I upgraded from iPhone X to 11 Pro Max. The Ultrawide lens, the improved telephoto lens, night mode, improved portrait options, all give exceptional results. The snaps taken by this phone could compete with some of the most professional DSLRs. 4K video recording support on front camera is an additional bonus.2. Battery Life. All the reviews have been right about this. I used to charge my iPhone X every night, whereas for the same amount of usage, now I have to charge the 11 Prod max once in 2 nights.3. Display. I was already a big fan of the 5.8' OLED display on the iPhone X. At 6.5' , 11 Pro Max offers the best OLED display I have come across smartphones.4. Face ID is faster. The apps and the interface work smoothly as ever.5. iOS 13, though still needs fixes, is a wonderful operating system. Dark mode is a welcome change.Overall, this is a beast. Admire Apple for catching up with its android counterparts on several of the features. The 11 Pro Max is definitely a phone for amateur & professional photographers.

  May be my first negative review about the product & Amazon both. I was much elated to receive the iPhone 11 so fast, next day of dispatch i.e. 28/09/19, but the thing I got started heating up every now and then. Contacted Applecare, just to be consoled that it's quite normal. As it continued, tried to return the product by speaking to Amazon customer support but in vain. Some body called me back to convey that only Apple will decide which one to take back. Why is then Amazon took up the sacred duty of selling such an item which they can't exchange/ have no control ? The product developed new issues like proximity sensor malfunction and last but most importantly loosing mobile network every other minute(even had two software updates). It was handed over to the Apple ASP as the return window closed on 10/10/19 (what use it was for??) and diagnosed as having issues and has further been sent to Apple repair facility at Bengaluru. So I'm here w/out my first iPhone after using it(suffering for??) just a little over 2 weeks and the CREDIT GOES TO AMAZON !! Bravo, keep it up Amazon.

At last they denied the phone replacement and even to provide the missing cord. For any damage or quality issues they said amazon is not responsible.

  The iPhone design is good and the camera quality is awesome. You can also take pictures in wide angles and the image quality is awesome.Phone got delivered at 9am on 28th September (I pre-order it on 27th September at 3am in the morning), I got my phone before the delivery date with nice and secured packaging.The overall look of the phone is premium and face unlocking is fast. I grabbed this phone with HDFC 6K Instant Discount Offer at Just 64K (128 GB Variant).Cons:1. The phone is great but if you use ""in the box"" accessories like ""EarPods with Lighting Connector"", then you might feel a little pain in your ears.2. The phone comes with 5W charger which charge your phone slowly. I recommend you to prefer using 18W charger.Well, I've never tried the iPhone before and I'm using this for the first time (Yes, I'm already using other apple products like MacBook Air & Pro).But the product is great and I'm just lovin it.

  Bought the mobile from appario retail ltd. Mobile is heating up within seconds and also camera modes aren’t working properly. Particularly in portrait mode, the stage light and mono options aren’t working properly.  i raised the same to apple customer care they confirmed that its not software issue. But the amazon customer care told me that they need a job card and report from apple service center. The nearest service center is located at 210km from my place, imagine the amount of strain and how much its going to cost. Before you buy anything from this seller just google it and u can find numerous complaints on this seller. What ever they sell u will find defective products only. There is a thread on this sellers dubious deals in quora. Please be safe and don’t regret after.

At last they denied the phone replacement and even to provide the missing cord. For any damage or quality issues they said amazon is not responsible.

  The iPhone design is good and the camera quality is awesome. You can also take pictures in wide angles and the image quality is awesome.Phone got delivered at 9am on 28th September (I pre-order it on 27th September at 3am in the morning), I got my phone before the delivery date with nice and secured packaging.The overall look of the phone is premium and face unlocking is fast. I grabbed this phone with HDFC 6K Instant Discount Offer at Just 64K (128 GB Variant).Cons:1. The phone is great but if you use ""in the box"" accessories like ""EarPods with Lighting Connector"", then you might feel a little pain in your ears.2. The phone comes with 5W charger which charge your phone slowly. I recommend you to prefer using 18W charger.Well, I've never tried the iPhone before and I'm using this for the first time (Yes, I'm already using other apple products like MacBook Air & Pro).But the product is great and I'm just lovin it.

  Bought the mobile from appario retail ltd. Mobile is heating up within seconds and also camera modes aren’t working properly. Particularly in portrait mode, the stage light and mono options aren’t working properly.  i raised the same to apple customer care they confirmed that its not software issue. But the amazon customer care told me that they need a job card and report from apple service center. The nearest service center is located at 210km from my place, imagine the amount of strain and how much its going to cost. Before you buy anything from this seller just google it and u can find numerous complaints on this seller. What ever they sell u will find defective products only. There is a thread on this sellers dubious deals in quora. Please be safe and don’t regret after.

  May be my first negative review about the product & Amazon both. I was much elated to receive the iPhone 11 so fast, next day of dispatch i.e. 28/09/19, but the thing I got started heating up every now and then. Contacted Applecare, just to be consoled that it's quite normal. As it continued, tried to return the product by speaking to Amazon customer support but in vain. Some body called me back to convey that only Apple will decide which one to take back. Why is then Amazon took up the sacred duty of selling such an item which they can't exchange/ have no control ? The product developed new issues like proximity sensor malfunction and last but most importantly loosing mobile network every other minute(even had two software updates). It was handed over to the Apple ASP as the return window closed on 10/10/19 (what use it was for??) and diagnosed as having issues and has further been sent to Apple repair facility at Bengaluru. So I'm here w/out my first iPhone after using it(suffering for??) just a little over 2 weeks and the CREDIT GOES TO AMAZON !! Bravo, keep it up Amazon.

  Decent packaging and shipping 👍 Upgraded from an iPhone X and I reckon its definitely worth it 😊 Size matters, no pun intended, and you can instantly feel the difference b/w a 5.7 inch screen and a 6.5 inch 🤓 If you have an iPhone X or earlier model, you should definitely consider upgrading. For iPhone XS Max, you are better off waiting for next year model as its touted to undergo some radical changes (5G, USB-C, Touch ID comeback and notch less design perhaps). No 5G in this model but doesn't make a difference, at least in India, as even the 5G spectrum has not been auctioned yet 😝  WiFi performance is better than iPhone X as this model supports 11ax protocol 🤗 And by the way, if you are stuck for choice b/w Gold and Midnight Green, go for Gold and thank me later ✨

  I Love the iPhone Pro Max, purchased from Amazon IN, on Oct 14th 2019. This space grey 64 GB base model was delivered to me on Oct 19th. Here are my objective views about this phone:What I didnt like:1. Obviously the price tag. At Rs. 1,09099.00 is a major deterrent when it comes to decide on buying a phone.2. The base model should certainly begin at 128 GB or higher. 64 GB is not gonna be enough when storing 4K videos.3. Optical zoom in camera is still 2X, where as Android phones already have 5X zooms.Now about what I love in this phone:1. The Camera. That is the main reason I upgraded from iPhone X to 11 Pro Max. The Ultrawide lens, the improved telephoto lens, night mode, improved portrait options, all give exceptional results. The snaps taken by this phone could compete with some of the most professional DSLRs. 4K video recording support on front camera is an additional bonus.2. Battery Life. All the reviews have been right about this. I used to charge my iPhone X every night, whereas for the same amount of usage, now I have to charge the 11 Prod max once in 2 nights.3. Display. I was already a big fan of the 5.8' OLED display on the iPhone X. At 6.5' , 11 Pro Max offers the best OLED display I have come across smartphones.4. Face ID is faster. The apps and the interface work smoothly as ever.5. iOS 13, though still needs fixes, is a wonderful operating system. Dark mode is a welcome change.Overall, this is a beast. Admire Apple for catching up with its android counterparts on several of the features. The 11 Pro Max is definitely a phone for amateur & professional photographers.

  Update (15/08/2020):Never give a chance to regret..  Go ahead...👍The Icons looks was not so great ..  And then I set 'Spherlue Icons' from theam and now its looks better with dark mode ...Even though its 6000 Mah I always leaves phone on charging before go to bed ( I like to see my phone 100% every morning 🙂 )..  So I turned off fast charging option.. You can do that.. Its will not affect  batteryMONSTER :1. Battery :- 5/5Two day battery standby for normal easy2.Display:- 4.99/5Super amaload with full hd.. Superb Display3.Design:3/5It has a6000Mah battery,  still looking not bulky. Noglass body,  but who cares after you put a back cover..  In my opinion, don't spend more money for glass body if you uses back covers4. Camera: 3/5Back camera pretty good but front camera's low light output is very low..  many features available such as slow and super slow videos available..5. OS&UI:- 5/5Android 10 with One UI6.Finger print reader and face lock 3/5 Face lock and finger print reader are not so fast7.Processor and performance 3.5/5Exynos 9611 is not meant for PUBG gamers  .. But for me its perfect as I am not a heavy gamer..  No lag ang hang till now..  but processor is outdated..8. Charging :2.5/5. No fast charging.. Provided with a 15W charger and iy takes about 3 Hrs to fully reacharge the phone9. Accessories : 2/5No earphone, No Back cover, No Screenguard..  So order backcover and tempered glass when you placing order as its backbody is plastic amd more prone to scratches..10.Loud speaker 1.5/5Loudspeaker sound level is very low.. (Keep earphones)Verdict: For this price  Its the best choice if you are not a hardcore gamer  ...

  I am writing my review after using it for 6 days.I have bought sumsung phone after 7 years hoping it could be good phone but samsung again disappointed me a lot.They claim it has 6000mAH battery but drain like 3000mAH and it take almost 2.30hrs to charge from 10% to 90% so its fast charging is not a fast charging. Its just a market gimic to clail it monester like features i.e.battery 6000mAH ,15W fast charge ete but reality is far far away from claims.Others features are as per price range but if you thinking for a battery packed phone with fast charge,then I would sugget plz search for others phone in same range.

With 6gb ram,128 GB internal storage and Amoled display I am more than satisfied.I have been using Samsung phones from the start. Samsung's Amoled screen is what I am attracted to the most. The feel it gives is simply amazing.But battery dont seem to be a 6000 mah.As far as a non gamer is concerned this phone is the best under this price range.

  May be my first negative review about the product & Amazon both. I was much elated to receive the iPhone 11 so fast, next day of dispatch i.e. 28/09/19, but the thing I got started heating up every now and then. Contacted Applecare, just to be consoled that it's quite normal. As it continued, tried to return the product by speaking to Amazon customer support but in vain. Some body called me back to convey that only Apple will decide which one to take back. Why is then Amazon took up the sacred duty of selling such an item which they can't exchange/ have no control ? The product developed new issues like proximity sensor malfunction and last but most importantly loosing mobile network every other minute(even had two software updates). It was handed over to the Apple ASP as the return window closed on 10/10/19 (what use it was for??) and diagnosed as having issues and has further been sent to Apple repair facility at Bengaluru. So I'm here w/out my first iPhone after using it(suffering for??) just a little over 2 weeks and the CREDIT GOES TO AMAZON !! Bravo, keep it up Amazon.

  Please do not buy expensive product like iphone from Amazon, i had very bad exp, the charger cord was missing and had sound quality issues. Amazon initial told charger doesn't come in box and when i challenged it they asked reimburse the cord amount, but i requested a replacement, after some days they called me and informed that they dont take responsibility of missing items, and 10 day replacement policy they dont follow, you can read the email conversation attached  here where i mentioned every thing, i have the call recordings as well. At last they denied the phone replacement and even to provide the missing cord. For any damage or quality issues they said amazon is not responsible.

  The iPhone design is good and the camera quality is awesome. You can also take pictures in wide angles and the image quality is awesome.Phone got delivered at 9am on 28th September (I pre-order it on 27th September at 3am in the morning), I got my phone before the delivery date with nice and secured packaging.The overall look of the phone is premium and face unlocking is fast. I grabbed this phone with HDFC 6K Instant Discount Offer at Just 64K (128 GB Variant).Cons:1. The phone is great but if you use ""in the box"" accessories like ""EarPods with Lighting Connector"", then you might feel a little pain in your ears.2. The phone comes with 5W charger which charge your phone slowly. I recommend you to prefer using 18W charger.Well, I've never tried the iPhone before and I'm using this for the first time (Yes, I'm already using other apple products like MacBook Air & Pro).But the product is great and I'm just lovin it.

  Bought the mobile from appario retail ltd. Mobile is heating up within seconds and also camera modes aren’t working properly. Particularly in portrait mode, the stage light and mono options aren’t working properly.  i raised the same to apple customer care they confirmed that its not software issue. But the amazon customer care told me that they need a job card and report from apple service center. The nearest service center is located at 210km from my place, imagine the amount of strain and how much its going to cost. Before you buy anything from this seller just google it and u can find numerous complaints on this seller. What ever they sell u will find defective products only. There is a thread on this sellers dubious deals in quora. Please be safe and don’t regret after.

  Decent packaging and shipping 👍 Upgraded from an iPhone X and I reckon its definitely worth it 😊 Size matters, no pun intended, and you can instantly feel the difference b/w a 5.7 inch screen and a 6.5 inch 🤓 If you have an iPhone X or earlier model, you should definitely consider upgrading. For iPhone XS Max, you are better off waiting for next year model as its touted to undergo some radical changes (5G, USB-C, Touch ID comeback and notch less design perhaps). No 5G in this model but doesn't make a difference, at least in India, as even the 5G spectrum has not been auctioned yet 😝  WiFi performance is better than iPhone X as this model supports 11ax protocol 🤗 And by the way, if you are stuck for choice b/w Gold and Midnight Green, go for Gold and thank me later ✨

  I Love the iPhone Pro Max, purchased from Amazon IN, on Oct 14th 2019. This space grey 64 GB base model was delivered to me on Oct 19th. Here are my objective views about this phone:What I didnt like:1. Obviously the price tag. At Rs. 1,09099.00 is a major deterrent when it comes to decide on buying a phone.2. The base model should certainly begin at 128 GB or higher. 64 GB is not gonna be enough when storing 4K videos.3. Optical zoom in camera is still 2X, where as Android phones already have 5X zooms.Now about what I love in this phone:1. The Camera. That is the main reason I upgraded from iPhone X to 11 Pro Max. The Ultrawide lens, the improved telephoto lens, night mode, improved portrait options, all give exceptional results. The snaps taken by this phone could compete with some of the most professional DSLRs. 4K video recording support on front camera is an additional bonus.2. Battery Life. All the reviews have been right about this. I used to charge my iPhone X every night, whereas for the same amount of usage, now I have to charge the 11 Prod max once in 2 nights.3. Display. I was already a big fan of the 5.8' OLED display on the iPhone X. At 6.5' , 11 Pro Max offers the best OLED display I have come across smartphones.4. Face ID is faster. The apps and the interface work smoothly as ever.5. iOS 13, though still needs fixes, is a wonderful operating system. Dark mode is a welcome change.Overall, this is a beast. Admire Apple for catching up with its android counterparts on several of the features. The 11 Pro Max is definitely a phone for amateur & professional photographers.

  Firstly, I am glad I have purchased this phone!For people confused between xs and xs max, take the xs, why? because xs max doesnt give you more screen space, it just enlarges the icons and the text. Even after upgrading the ios to 12.0.1, there seems to be no difference, I think the screen could have been used to fit in more text compared to the Xs. having said that, im used to big phones, the Pixel 2xl, the 6sPlus, so if you are a big phone person, go for this phone with eyes closed.If you are confused between apple and android flagships, let me tell you, I was on HTC for 3 years, then shifted to iphone 6s plus for 3 years and briefly shifted to pixel 2 xl, and  now finally to Xs Max, which I intend to use for the next 3 years. having used both, I definitely feel iphones are quite premium and offer the best tech. I mean when I think about it, who invented face ID? who designed the notch? Almost all phones come with these features these days and after adapting to iphones technology, the other phones are going a step ahead, so definitely, apple is the trend setter! Comparing pixel 2xl with Xs Max, I found that the pixel 2 xl and even the pixel 2 get damn hot, definitely not the issue on the iphone. Iphone looks much better too! GREAT DISPLAY! Also great touch interface! its really smooth. Having said that, Its all personal choice!I really love my purchase! and now I know why some people are reluctant to switch to android from iphone!

  The iPhone XS Max combines a big OLED screen, great speakers, great cameras, great battery life, and blazing fast speed into the best user experience on a smartphone. For the record, Apple will support this phone with software updates for 5 years...the Note 9 is a 2018 phone running 2017 Android software and Samsung gives software updates for 3 years. I’ll list some pros and cons and also what the tech media won’t tell you.Pros:- battery life is all day- upgraded speakers get real loud- Face ID is faster- fast and smooth- Siri has been given shortcuts- upgraded cameras are just as good as Samsung cameras now and the front camera is better than the Note 9 front cameraCons:- expensive- slow speed charger- no headphone jack- it’s made of glass on the front and back. A case is almost mandatory especially if you are clumsyBottom line...the iPhone and Galaxy phones are the best phones on the market right now. The iPhone is a step ahead because iOS gets frequent updates and starting with iOS 12 Apple actually sped up old iPhones and iPads which will allow users to keep their devices longer. An iPhone is now like a laptop and something you only need to upgrade once it breaks. The iPhone is also the ONLY smartphone that can stream all video apps in full screen. Android doesn’t have full screen built into the OS so video apps like HBO, Showtime, Cinemax, STARZ, Encore, and EPIC are all tiny on the Note 9...those apps are all full screen on the iPhone. Food for thought.

  Despite ordering the world class mobile, vibration function is not working since day one. Had gone through blogs and there was hope that it be a software issue and will get fixed. But unfortunately 2 months are over and even with the latest iOS 12.1.2, vibration function not working. I work in Nigeria and now do not know how to get it replaced.

  It’s a must upgrade from iPhone 5S to iPhone 7. Excellent speed and battery life and everyone knows about camera quality. No doubt those who can’t afford it will never have a chance to use this phone. These people are everywhere crying out loud about price tag, but once you buy it and use it you will know it’s worth. Amazon is excellent in delivering packages securely to customers.

  Finally I decided to go with Apple as it now has an LED screen instead of IPS LCD screens that Iphone 8+ and previous versions had.. ( I also used my dads iphoneX for around 2 months and decided to go for this when I was convinced) Though it is expensive, i believe its worth the money.. I feel its much more secure than Android and its not forcing me to have Facebook, Youtube etc that my Previous Samsung phones always did... Just to let y’ll know that I was a big fan of samsung.. I have used Note 1,2,3,4,8 S4, S7 edge etc.. Though its screen was good.. they use to slow down after some time of use.. I purchased an Apple only after positive reviews from my friends and I am loving this so far.. 3 GB RAM in iphone x or 4 GB RAM here in iPhone XS is far better than 6 GB ram in a Samsung.. I also play PUBG and I am also loving the Gaming experience.. Very important, it runs on High graphics mode where as my Note 8 use to work on medium graphics even when I used the mobile on Gaming, High performance or Entertainment mode... So, I am loving my iPhone so far..And the face ID is just awesome...

  I had bought a brand new iPhone XS in April, 2019 for about INR 1,00,000 (1 Lakh). My phone had fallen off my sofa and onto the floor and I had a small crack on the phone. I remember seeing 1 year limited warranty and so I booked an appointment at the nearby service center. When I visited the center, the service person told me that I had to pay a fee of INR 33,000/- to get the screen fixed. Rs. 33,000/- for repairing a display !! When I inquired about Apple Care protection on the device, he mentioned that Apple does not have any warranty against Screen damages in India and it is available in US and other countries.1. Is Apple expecting its users to change the phone which costs almost 1 lakh just becuse there is a crack on the screen?2. One Plus is providing free screen replacement warranty for a year that costs half the price of iPhone.3. Why can't iPhone users in India enjoy Apple Care + benefit similar to other country users for a small premium?4. This strongly discourages Indian consumers to go for an expensive phone if screen damages are not covered. Apple gadgets users are at a disadvantage if expensive costs for maintenance continues.

  Disappointed due the Camera of Xs (In low light/indoor photography face output will be totally artificial). In comparison with my old iPhone6s, I vote for 6s for low light/indoor photography. (I am not talking about selfie camera issue. I identified issue with main camera)Contacted Apple service centre and their response is “that is how iPhone X & iPhone Xs designed”Raised issue to Apple customer care number and shared the sample pics and other required data to analyse. Apple customer care came back to me after a week asking pictures by providing multiple scenarios. I have seen similar post for iPhone Xs MAX with the same issue in apple forum and the final response from Apple is: check lighting while taking pics.I am not sure why very less people has raised this issue in Xs Camera reviews (started digging more and observed in reviews only after facing the issue)Please note that, iPhone can’t be returned to Amazon without the approval from Apple. Apple don’t agree it’s as issue. Totally disappointed.This might be best Camera in some scenarios, but for me it’s a total disappointment.

  As a tech and apple enthusiast : This is one beautiful piece of tech and engineering marvel . From its seem less design to its attention to minute details (thx to the designing team behind it) , it will force you to agree that its insane price tag is justified the moment you hold it . I can never believe myself  of how much my views have changed about this product and Apple from it release to the moment I had it in my hands .Well if you want to know specs and comparisons well you have youtube , there are plenty of reviews there but if you are ready to buy such an expensive piece without selling your kidney then those reviews and comparisons don't matter to you I guess .My review :Camera : trustworthy , reliable , takes very aggressive HDR shots at times but generally neutral with its performance , you will find yourself editing the pictures a lot and I never complained it as I love doing it and when the base material is so detailed and accurate to begin with that you never lose any significant amount of quality after many editing cycles .Battery : Respectable AF ! Never expected this from a sub par capacity battery , while it is not the best , its at a very respectable position for sure  , it surely will surprise you once you use it .Speed : The king of phones in speed period .Design : 10/10Negatives - Face ID doesn't work in landscape , Charges slow .

  Personally i feel the XS is a complete phone. My last Iphone 6 worked flawlessly for 3 yearsI was confused between note 9, xs, one plus 6T and other latest handsets.Finally chose IOS over android as it is more polished than android and the apps in my opinion work better on an IOSDid not go for the Max as i prefer the smaller size.Price is definitely high and i got it in a nice deal from amazon which knocked off 20k on the price tagPlus got free screen replacement cover, no interest EMITips:Wait for a SALE to get maximum savings. This phone is worth it if you are getting it at a good deal. get a cover

  I purchased iphone X on 26th Oct'18 and started using from 28th Oct'18. When i received the product, it was already opened which i informed Amazon representative but i was told that it is original product and it will not have issue. Within two days, it started giving me issue with network & WiFi connectivity. I again contacted Amazon through app but i was directed to Apple support. After talking to Apple representative, i only got indefinite answer like it could be software issue and i should wait till it updates but Amazon return/replace policy valid for only 10 days. After purchasing a phone worth up to 90k, i had to do all this and still no support from Amazon.

  This is my 3rd iPhone after iPhone 4S and iPhone 6S Plus.Being an utter working middle class guy, I don't switch my iPhones very often (my android phones barely lasted me 9 months though). I do consider them extremely expensive, and I wouldn't go for one, unless I felt it was worth the money I was paying for it.Pros:- I got this phone for INR 69,999/- from Amazon. With exchange offer, it cost me a little over 60K. For the price (and that price only), this makes it worth the buy.- It may not be the latest and greatest, but compared to iPhone XR, this is a much better package overall. Considering the XR is now priced higher than X. XS is only marginally better, and didn't feel it was worth the extra 30K.- Even after a year of being on the market, this phone is an absolute beast in terms of performance, especially after iOS 12.- The Camera is a beauty. You can't compare with DSLRs, but it is right up there with OnePlus and Google phones.- Looks exactly like the XS, and doesn't even have the S badging. So no one will be the wiser.Cons:- The delivery was a bit of a hassle. I had opted for One Day Delivery, at my work address. The agent reached at 7:30 in the morning, when I was obviously not at work. He did say he will come later in the afternoon. However, received the phone a day later.- The phone is extremely slippery. Invest in a good case, front screen protector and a rear glass protector- Such expensive phones should come with 128GB of storage as base, instead of 64GB. If you record 4K videos, it will eat up your storage really quickly.- Videos get heavily cropped when watching in full screen mode. If you have the money, go for XS Max.- The battery isn't the best. Takes over two hours to fully charge from 5% to 100% even with the iPad charger. With moderate usage, you can get 8 hours barely.- With the price of the phone, should have at least come with the fast charger in the box.

  Thanks to Appario Retail Private Ltd, I got this 256 GB beast during amazon great Indian sale for under 80k. Additionally received cash back of Rs.1000. On delivery, I checked at imei24 and apple site  (checkcoverage) for authenticity and warranty of the product. I was satisfied as the product was 100% genuine.iPhone is buttery smooth and the full screen is an awesome experience. Personally, I love the notch as it gives character to the phone. No matter how much you hate the design it seems this is quite an ""IN"" thing now for almost all phone manufacturers have started copying Apple. So all you detractors out there of Apple and the notch - take a chill pill :)!!Pros:1) A11 Bionic Processor is blazing fast and coupled with 3GB ram you will never have any issues with any of the heavy duty tasks you throw at it2) Screen resolution (Super retina HD) and the contrast ratio makes the viewing experience breathtaking3) Got the A1865 model ( iPhone X A1865 uses the Qualcomm MDM9655 Snapdragon X16 LTE modem while the iPhone X A1901 has the Intel XMM 7480 modem) which is better than the A1901 model as A1865 covers more cellular bands (GSM and CDMA networks and frequencies) and the performance of Qualcomm’s chips has always been better than Intel’s. LTE speeds and cellular receptions in case of weak signals also are a shade better than A1901.Cons:1) All glass body makes this susceptible to breakage. So recommend having a case around it (preferably a transparent one so that the beauty of the original phone can still be enjoyed!)2) I have to say that battery life is average - a shade better than iPhone 8.3) Additional touch id support would have been better as an alternative unlocking optionWill come up with a detailed review soon in a couple of weeks.

  Its been hardly 16 days and the phone stopped working, took it to Apple auth service centre wherein they sent it to Bangalore assuring us a new phone would be provided. After 3 days the same phone was given to us with few parts being replaced however within 5 minutes the ohone showed similar problem for which it was sent to bangalore. Irritated and helpless we had to again send it to bangalore. Now we are waiting to get a new phone instead of a repaired one as we paid such a hefty amount for a great iphone experience.

  Redmi phones cameras are great, of course iPhone is better but is the 6 more Redmi phones that I can get for 1 iPhone justifiable for such a difference in price? Well, absolutely yes.iPhone camera is not just better, it is so much better than comparing them are like comparing a Alto with BMW, yes both have 4 wheels, both have AC, both can run at 100 kmph, but you know the difference.The high price of iPhone is so justified by the sheer brilliance of camera it has. Sure it is just 12 MP, but the clarity, my o my!Sure the battery is just about 2600 compared to 3500 of a Redmi, but it lasts longer than a Redmi.I know I am comparing a low budget phone to a premium one, but there are so many people (I was one of them) who were not able to see the reason behind the steep price of iPhone.I have been using a MacBook for 10 years and since my work depends on it, I need it, but a phone? Why? It is not a necessity like the laptop, it is just for calling and taking pics occasionally, and I have my SLR for photography.But I was so wrong, an iPhone is an iPhone. Once you use it, there is no turning back.My last iPhone was a 4S and then since I love buying phones every 6 months, I shifted to Android (Redmi, Samsung, Honor) to satiate my hunger for new phones. All these phones are superb, no doubt, but once you use the iPhone 7, you know that the difference between these phones and iPhone 6s has got much bigger because of the camera.And features like Airdrop (100 pics transferred from the phone to Macbook within 4-5 seconds) are so good if you are using both iPhone and Macbook.Bottom line, iPhone 7 has jumped a big leap from the 6s and the 8 is almost similar. The X is double the price of a 7, so probably all things taken in account, the iPhone 7 is the best value for money among all phones in India

I don’t feel the need to upgrade to some other device (iphone 8, x or xs) because it works flawlessly without any lag or delay whatsoever. The camera is great.The only problem is the battery life which isn’t enough for a complete day.

  This is best thing you can get at this price from a reputed brand with Made in India tag. First time I ordered on the first day of online launch and am happy. I'm writing after few days of usage, but this should not be different as my experience with Samsung has been most consistent as compared to other mobile brands I've used earlier.Good:- Android 10! Beautiful looks! Finally I can delete SMS from notification now!!- Display is excellent with Blue light filter.- Performance is good. No heating or lagging. Real Racing worked fine.- 6000 Mah battery is BIG- 128 GB storage is pretty good. 512 GB card supported with dedicated external card slot.- Both dedicated sim slots support LTE- Fast charging and 15W charger top with phone. The phone came with 0% charge. Charged fast.- Mobile speakers sound is good, but I prefer external speakers for better bass in music.- Camera is really good. Macro performance is very good - look at skin in tatoo photo and dust perticles in deskphone photo!! (photos of M31 are from other phone). Both front and rear camera support FHD video 3840x2160. I may not require to carry my DSLR everyehere.- Face unlock / figure-print sensor response is good- Received next day by 11 AM !Not So Good:- Not that thin, but ok.- Doesn't have Samsung Dex- Started to Boot Screen!! Gave me a little shock but selected reboot option and then every thing was smooth. An Android Updated (other than many application updates which is normal in any case) appeared on within days of launch. But update was smooth. No issue at all.- Feels delicate in hand but a Rs.49 cover was good enough. Wrongly ordered black while the set is blue. Just 49 so will reorder the blue one as well :)- Called Samsung Store, but no information with them about availability date. Still no call from them.Feedback- Feels good in hand and in use. It is a powerhouse and you feel it.- Will update after few days of use, but don't have any doubt as of now.Go for it without any doubt.

  Lets just begin with the obvious. This phone's quality doesn't meet the claims made.Cons:1. Camera Quality: Picture quality is just awful. Its worse than a 8MP camera. The pixelization is obvious and it is definitely not a 64MP camera. Do not believe the claims Samsung might make. The quad camera is of no use as the macro camera reminds me of the decade when VGA cameras were common.2. Battery: Samsung may claim the battery will last for two days but it didnt last that long - no Netflix, Prime Video, heavy games being used. So that makes two of the biggest features useless.3. Amazon's Policy: In case you don't like the phone, Amazon has made sure you are stuck with it. The switch from 10 day ""return"" policy to 10 day ""replacement"" policy is dowright wrong! Hold onto the shutters physical mobile stores - your days are not over yet. When you do request for replacement, there is an inspection of the phone at buyer's site - which I understand but the fact that replacement will occur almost on the 10th day from my purchase still keeps me at unease.Pros:1. Display: The screen quality is good and has adjustment options for warm light and cold light.2. Performance: Streaming videos and playing heavy games was smooth for the first 4 days but then again Samsung is known for fast deterioration of performance, so I will keep my eyes and ears open.3. Sound: Speaker quality is okay but not upto the mark. In a noisy place you fail to hear the crispness and the boom.

  I am using it from 3 days , 6000 mah battery is just for name only, it work for 1-1.25 days only with moderate usage.64mp camera doesn't support zoom, camera doesn't support 60fps video recording.Build quality is not good, plastic back with lots of figure prints in few minutes handling, not look new in few seconds.Face unlock very slow.Heat issue which charging and heavy usageFull charge takes more than 3 hrsWould not recommend to buy , if you are looking  for good camera phonego with other brands like oppo or redmi , giving much better quality

  The phone was wrapped in dust. Although it was seal packed, still many dust were on screen and back side. It shows security concerns and Amazon, Samsung and seller must draw its attention. How dust can be reached in seal packed box? Now I'm lacking trust in Amazon,Samsung and seller. Either my phone was used or its components might have replaced, as in brand new phone,there exists no dusts because they are built in factory, but here shows how they are playing with the customer and their product.Phone is nice, large battery backup of more than 2 days, 6.4 display is big, camera is perfect and 6GB ram is enough for daily usage. All things are good. No heating issue.However my only concern is ""dust"" and how it came there if its brand new.So I could give 5 star,but now 1 is enough.Beware of Amazon,Samsung and seller.

  Not a Samsung performance. It seems it was launched without proper test n trials. I already had M30 so decided to buy M31 (6GB). But got shocked to see the poor performance n battery life. The 64MP images can't be sent easily to someone on WhatsApp. Camera give errors now n then. Battery life worst then M30 which has 5000mh. Mobile heats on charging.

  This phone is not worth for 28k, performance is very bad. After using it for 7 day's I'm writing this review.1. I am not a gamer or don't run any app to consume high performance. I have the regular banking and social apps and default phone apps. Internal memory not consumed more then 20gb. Still this phone takes time to load home page. This is really ridiculous.2. Some modes in this phone are not working exactly upto the mark.  A. Dark mode - it will not change to dark mode by the time I select, May change when phone wishes to do. Viseversa if i would like deselect dark mode.  B. When loading - screen flickering occurs often in many common applications. GDrive, Gpay, whatsapp and opera browser.  C. Receivers are not seeing my face in whatsapp app video call, in duo its working fine. Only in my call receivers facing this issue.Camera I did not test much, but I didn't see any issues. Clarity is good.Finget scan is not fast compare to competitor phones.My overall rating is 1 for 5Complaint s registered with Amazon, Technician did not visit to inspect the phone. All the above complaints works randomly, I had screen recored and shots for proof to show.

  The product is fine and working well. Battery and camera quality is phenomenal and met the expectations.  Unfortunately the Amazon promise on zero cost EMI is misleading. I opted for 6 months EMI considering zero percent interest. But HDFC bank charged me around 12% interest plus GST etc. This is like taking customer for a ride.  I was surprised to receive a msg like that from bank. Just to alert Amazon to rectify this immediately.

  The battery life is good but doesn't contains a Fast Charger,even the storage is spacious. The Camera quality is fine and totally meets the expectation. The overall phone is nice but not strong enough to handle highly specified apps, like we can easily notice the lags while scrolling up/down in the YouTube trending and Instagram surfing threads. The frame rate has already been dropped. So, won't be able to access PUBG or COD not more than Low graphics and Medium FPS even the response is slower (as if playing Devil May Cry 4 in AMD Athlon processor attached PC)

  I simply liked it when i unboxed it and saw it at first glance. Its 16.15 cms display is quite impressive. Most of the time i watch movies while travelling to and from office . Hence I can have a better screen view now. The camera is also excellent.Overall a nice phone within a nominal budget. I’ll give it a 5 stars for now.

  I was looking for a budget smart phone which can perform the entire task for me. I was using MI note 6 and looking for something fresh bcz I was bored with it’s UI. I explored the content available over internet and waited for it to buy after getting the right fitment against my requirement. I am so excited to share my personal experience after my early purchase of this device. I love taking pictures of mine and surrounding too. So great camera quality is one of my main priority, after using it now I must say that it has the best camera available in this budget.It’s plastic made but mirror finish back panel is the coolest thing in my blue colour device. I also appreciate the makers for understanding our further need and offering the tempered glass and transparent back cover for device protection. Once you will keep the device handy it will give you a feel of it. With the brand tag line of Vivo “Camera & Music” it really impressed me.I’ll surely recommend my fellow buyers to buy this cool device. But there is also something which can be improved so writing it in bullet points for your ease..Pros:-● It’s really a 100% value for money device.● Run on latest version of Android “9”.● In Box soft back cover and tempered glass.● Dedicated kid mode for safety against unwanted operational activity of kids● Finger print sensor in back of the device is at perfectly placed in the reach of fingers and open the device faster.● 5000Ah battery, allows to watch many hours online video● HD+ screen Resolution and balanced colour contrast makes the viewing experience really pleasure and never hurt eyes● Triple camera with AI and image editing options are among the best features for me● Fast charging support with 18 watt inbox adaptor● Snapdragon 665 processor is really a power pack performer even in multitaskingCons:-● Lags in PubG (However in a device with 4 GB it’s expected as the game itself take 2 GB space)● No headphones included● Front Camera struggles in low light.At the price of 10990 its a great phone for better multitasking. Vivo has finally started improving specs and is doing good with their phones in the segment.I hope my review helped you in making your right decision!

  The device is too heavy don't go for it. Also it lags a lot despite having a Snapdragon processor of 600 series with 3gb 64 gb storage.

  I was looking for a phone to be gifted to my mom... But below 10k the configurations and brands weren't enough pleasing but then when I found Vivo it was just so perfect.The color of the back side of mobile is so elegant,the camera quality is also very good, clear and battery life is great.

  This is a review as a moderate user.1. Agate red is stylish......2. Battery life stands three days with moderate gaming of aproximate 1 hr per day (free fire) on low power mode.3. Camera is ok for this price range.4. Dispay is good.5. Gaming performace is good when playing freefire in smooth and standard settings.6. There are lots of feature in this phone like low power mode, ultra power saving mode, game mode, one hand mode, etc... Check YouTube videos for the features.7. Finger print reader and face recognition is fast. I prefer finger print and turn off face recognition for saving battery life.8. The best thing is, I bought this phone using amazon paylater for zero emi for three months.

  I bought it for my mother, she uses to make video calls and surfing YouTube. Ideal for basic use. The pricing could be 1k less for this kind of configuration. Over all good product if you are not going to play games and keep cleaning junk from your phone. Like other vivo phones it also has unwanted advertisements.

  Superb battery backup, till now no hanging issue noticed. Very good mobile for the basic users. Camera quality is average and u can see noise in the picture taken. Finger print sensor & facial recognition works well even with mask on. No issues with the mobile network & 4G data connectivity, data reception is very good. But WIFI part works slow with 75 to 90 mbps line showing on other handsets & laptop, this mobile will show only 10 to 11 mbps max.Overall good mobile for basic user.

  Snapdragon 655 has higher performance rating than Snapdragon 720g in verse.com reviews. Don't know what reviews and versions people are talking about...5000mah battery, 8GB ram, quad cam with wide angle and macro, for this price , this is pretty neat phone.

  Amazon should give option to give less than 1 star.This phone is coming with very old processor Snapdragon 665. It is better to go with Samsung exynos  or Xiaomi 8 pro or 9 pro.So please please buyers don't waste your money on this useless phone.
