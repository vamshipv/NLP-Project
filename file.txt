Task	Recommendation
Chunking	    Split long reviews into smaller chunks (e.g., 100–200 words).
Top-k Retrieval	Retrieve top 3–5 chunks per query to avoid overloading the generator.
Batching	    Use batching for embedding and retrieval to speed things up.
Memory	        Use FAISS with flat or HNSW index for fast, scalable search.
Context Window	Keep total input to flan-t5-base under ~512 tokens for best results.


🚀 When to Consider Upgrading:
If you notice:

Poor retrieval relevance → consider bge-large or E5-large
Weak or generic generation → try flan-t5-xl or mistral-7b-instruct

make a UI for this

4. LangChain + Streamlit or Gradio (For RAG-specific tools)
Why: LangChain has built-in support for RAG pipelines.
Features: Easily connect retrievers, generators, and vector stores.
Pros: Modular, scalable, integrates with FAISS, Chroma, etc.
Cons: Slightly steeper learning curve.

---------------
1. Confidence Scoring
Compare similarity scores of retrieved documents.
If the top-k scores are below a threshold (e.g., cosine similarity < 0.4), assume the query is out-of-context.
Action: Return a fallback message like:
“Sorry, I couldn’t find any relevant reviews to answer that question.”

2. Answer Grounding Check
Before passing to the generator, check if the retrieved documents contain keywords from the query.
If not, skip generation and notify the user.
3. Retrieval-Only Mode (Optional)
Show the retrieved reviews to the user before generating an answer.
Let them decide if the context is relevant enough.
4. Prompt Engineering for Generator
Add instructions like:
“Only answer based on the provided reviews. If the information is not available, say ‘I don’t know.’”

5. Add a “No Answer” Option
Train or fine-tune your generator to explicitly say “I don’t know” when the context is insufficient.
You can also use a classifier to detect unanswerable queries.

---------------------Sentimental
How to Handle This in Your RAG System:
1. Emotion-Aware Query Detection
Use simple rules or a sentiment classifier to detect emotional tone:

If the query contains words like “fed up,” “tired,” “frustrated,” “just tell me,” etc., flag it as emotionally charged.
2. Empathetic Acknowledgment
Before jumping into the answer, respond with empathy:

“I hear you — it can be really overwhelming to sort through so many reviews. Let me help you find a solid recommendation.”

This builds trust and makes the system feel more human-centered.

3. Simplified, Confident Recommendation
Instead of summarizing reviews, switch to a direct suggestion:

“Based on thousands of reviews, the Canon EOS R50 is a top pick for beginners who want great image quality and ease of use.”

You can still use RAG behind the scenes to justify the recommendation, but present it clearly and confidently.

 Implementation Ideas:
Add a sentiment classifier (e.g., textblob, vader, or a small transformer model).
Use a fallback prompt for emotionally charged queries:
“The user is frustrated and wants a quick recommendation. Based on the reviews, suggest one good camera clearly and concisely.”

-----------------------------------------------

question suggestion after the first user query
Option 1: Rule-Based Suggestions
Based on the original query, suggest related questions using templates.

Example: User: “Is this camera good for low light?”
Suggestions:

“How does it perform in daylight?”
“What do users say about the battery life?”
“Is it good for beginners?”
Option 2: Embedding-Based Similar Questions
Use a small set of pre-written questions.
Embed them using all-MiniLM-L6-v2.
Find the top-k most similar to the user’s query.
Option 3: Generator-Based Suggestions
Use flan-t5-base or another model to generate follow-up questions.

Prompt Example:

“Suggest 3 follow-up questions a user might ask after: ‘Is this camera good for low light?’”

Option 4: Use Retrieved Reviews
Extract common themes or unanswered aspects from the retrieved reviews and turn them into questions.
