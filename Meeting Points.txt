# Conversation Summary: Building a RAG System with all-MiniLM-L6-v2 and Flan

## Introduction
You are building a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system using all-MiniLM-L6-v2 for embeddings and Flan for generation. You plan to use the Amazon review dataset and incorporate sentiment analysis into the summaries.

## Key Points Discussed

### 1. Preprocessing the Data
- **Text cleaning**: Remove HTML tags, special characters, and excessive whitespace.
- **Language filtering**: Keep only English reviews if your model is English-based.
- **Deduplication**: Remove duplicate reviews.
- **Length filtering**: Filter out very short or excessively long reviews.
- **Sentiment labeling**: Infer sentiment from star ratings (e.g., 1–2 stars = negative, 3 = neutral, 4–5 = positive).
- **Tokenization**: Tokenize or chunk long reviews.

### 2. Choosing the Dataset
#### Ni Jiajun’s Amazon Dataset
- **Pros**: Large, well-structured, widely used in academic research.
- **Cons**: Last updated around 2018–2019, some categories are very large.

#### Amazon Reviews 2023 Dataset
- **Pros**: More recent data (2023), reflects newer product trends.
- **Cons**: Less widely used, verify structure and completeness of metadata.

### 3. Sentiment Analysis Models
#### Pretrained Models (Recommended)
- **distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english**: Fast, lightweight, binary sentiment.
- **cardiffnlp/twitter-roberta-base-sentiment**: Trained on social media data, outputs positive, neutral, negative.
- **nlptown/bert-base-multilingual-uncased-sentiment**: Outputs star ratings (1–5), good for mimicking Amazon’s rating system.

#### Train Your Own Model
- Use Amazon reviews with star ratings as labels.
- Fine-tune a model like bert-base-uncased or distilbert-base-uncased.

### 4. Structuring Data for Retrieval
#### Option 1: Structured Embedding + Metadata Indexing
- **Steps**:
  - Load and filter dataset to include Cell Phones & Accessories.
  - Preprocess review text.
  - Generate embeddings for review text using all-MiniLM-L6-v2.
  - Store metadata separately.
  - Use a vector DB to store embeddings and metadata.

#### Option 2: Attribute-Aware Chunking
- **Steps**:
  - Everything in Option 1.
  - Extract or classify review segments by attribute (e.g., battery, screen, durability).
  - Chunk reviews into smaller parts focused on specific attributes.
  - Embed each chunk and store with attribute tags in metadata.

### 5. Effort Estimation
#### Option 1: Structured Embedding + Metadata Indexing
- **Initial setup**: 1–2 days
- **Query + retrieval logic**: 1 day
- **Testing and tuning**: 1–2 days

#### Option 2: Attribute-Aware Chunking
- **Initial setup**: 2–3 days
- **Attribute extraction logic**: 2–4 days
- **Testing and tuning**: 2–3 days

### Recommendation
Start with Option 1 to get your pipeline working smoothly. Once that’s solid, layer in Option 2 for more advanced capabilities.

## Next Steps
Would you like a starter script for Option 1 using the Cell Phones & Accessories category? I can also help you design the metadata schema or set up FAISS.
