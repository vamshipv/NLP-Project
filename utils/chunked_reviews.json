        "text": "I was hoping that this product might be able to activate the \"AC Charging\" speed on my Droid Charge like the car outlet & OEM charger did, but it appears to also operate at the significantly slower \"USB Charging\" rate. Also, it seems like the product has a loose connection and seems to easily disconnect when plugged into the car outlet, leading to even LESS charging time. I'm not sure if this is a problem with my car. It's not particularly old (2004) or the product, but it's disappointment either way.",
