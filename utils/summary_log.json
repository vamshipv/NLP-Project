        "Fast delivery, good price, good condition. Was what I expected. No problems or inconveniences experienced with this purchase. Convenient and satisfactory purchase.",
        "It's everything and more than as advertised. I've recommended it to my friends and family, and I would not hesitate to purchase it again.",
        "I had a very good experience with this seller. My merchandise arrived early and in excellent condition. I would definitley transact business with this seller again.",
        "I was also shocked to hear all the positive compliments I was hearing from people at my job, fitness center, and throughout the community. Everybody was loving the case, and what they don't know is that it cost me 60 % CHEAPER then all the other brand. This is the best purchase I've made on the internet, and I am going to buy more for my family in time for the Holidays. THANK YOU POWERBEAR!!!!!!!!!!!!! !",
        "I bought the brand name because they are made much better than the one generic which broke in a month.",

This reflects on the seller and to me gives me the impression that they really do not care about the buyer by accurately managing the content of what they are selling online (product and photo/images)and just want to get a sale.",

        "Love my case. Looks great!! Came fast. Thanks a ton. Feels really solid and fits perfect. I do not know what else to say about it but everytime I click submit it tells me to say more. There that shoul be enough words geeze, its a phone case not a car.",
        "This is highly good quality charger. I am happy I bought this. It is original samsung that matches my phone brand. I recommend this to everyone looking for the best car charger. : - )",
        "I am a truck driver, so obviously having a car charger is majorly important for me to keep all my electronics charged. I ordered this one a while back, and it doesn't work at all. I don't believe this is reflective of Samsung and the quality of their products....more than likely this was just a bad one out of the bunch.",
        "I bought this thinking it would be the same quality as an \"official\" Samsung car charger, but it most definitely isn't. My charger worked fine for about 2 months. Between regular usage on my Samsung Epic and letting people in the car with the same port plug in their phone, the charger no longer works properly. In the beginning, I could talk on the phone or have it in any position while charging. Over the 2 months the charger started getting more particular about what position it could be charged in.",
        "Good service. The product worked well. Really liked the price!! They want more words for the review but it's a simple item and it works.",
        "This works great for my Sprint Samsung Gallexy S2 phnone and for the price I should have gotten one for each car. I would buy this again for sure.",
        "The charger works well, and doesn't have a light on if the phone isn't charging so it doesn't drain your car battery. It is Samsung OEM product, so you know it will work fine with your Samsung phone, and saves a ton of money over buying a carrier branded one. Glad I got it!",
        "Excellent product! This is by far the best car charger that I've had for this phone! Love it! Love it!",
        "Looks good and gets positive feedback. It's not very hard mental and dents easily however. It's clearly not OEM but it's a fun accessory for your phone and for your Porsche.",
        "better than the one i got with the cel phone. can keep it in the car and its there when i need it.",
        "excellent unit and compact to keep phone charged on trips. keep in car for those times when on trips.great little unit very compact",
        "This review is more for the company and not for the product. It's an OEM Samsung charger so it really has nothing to do with the quality of SF Planet. But to say the least SF Planet came through for me in a very short time and with exactly what I wanted. The charger stopped working so I contacted the company for a replacement. They responded in less than 12 hours and are sending a brand new replacement to my home address. I appreciate their quick response and customer service.James Garner"

The only issue I have with it is occasionally it will pop open at the bottom.. but it only seems to happen when there is a significant change in temp.. guess that's probly due to the hard plastic material it is made of. But overall a great and inexpensive product! !",

Case was nice ....but can't handle rough punishment .....broke third day I had it ....put it in my pocket the side caught and broke .....could have gone with out it I ordered the black and pink leopard case but instead was greeted with the multi - colored case in which had looked like it had been used before (i.e. scratches, worn, faded spots).Nevertheless, it is a very good case and does it's job well. It was a cute case, but too flimsy and not what I was looking for in general. This is a very nice case I braught for my wife on her birthday she loves it very much especially the color. When i first got this case i really loved it but in a matter of about a week the pink started to rub off just from it being in my bag! I loved the case when I got it in the mail.",
