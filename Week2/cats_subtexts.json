From a tiny child to the present, the lo", "ve of Nature has been\nmy chief delight; animals and birds have not only been objects of study,\nbut o", "f deep and absorbing interest. I have noted their habits, watched\ntheir ways, and found lasting plea", "sure in their companionship. This love\nof animal life and Nature, with all its moods and phases, has", " grown with\nme from childhood to manhood, and is not the least enjoyable part of my\nold age.\n\nAmong ", "animals possibly the most perfect, and certainly the most\ndomestic, is the Cat. I did not think so a", "lways, having had a bias\nagainst it, and was some time coming to this belief; nevertheless, such\nis ", "the fact. It is a veritable part of our household, and is both\nuseful, quiet, affectionate, and orna", "mental. The small or large dog may\nbe regarded and petted, but is generally _useless_; the Cat, a pe", "t or\nnot, _is of service_. Were it not for our Cats, rats and mice would\noverrun our house, building", "s, cultivated and other lands. If there were\nnot _millions_ of Cats, there would be _billions_ of ve", "rmin.\n\nLong ages of neglect, ill-treatment, and absolute cruelty, with little\nor no gentleness, kind", "ness, or training, have made the Cat\nself-reliant; and from this emanates the marvellous powers of\no", "bservation, the concentration of which has produced a state analogous\nto reasoning, not unmixed with", " timidity, caution, wildness, and a\nretaliative nature.\n\nBut should a new order of things arise, and", " it is nurtured, petted,\ncosseted, talked to, noticed, and _trained_, with mellowed firmness and\nten", "der gentleness, then in but a few generations much evil that bygone\ncruelty has stamped into its oft", "en wretched existence will disappear,\nand it will be more than ever not only a useful, serviceable h", "elpmate,\nbut an object of increasing interest, admiration, and cultured beauty,\nand, thus being of v", "alue, profitable.\n\nHaving said this much, I turn to the pleasurable duty of recording my\ndeep sense ", "of the kindness of those warm-hearted friends who have\nassisted me in \"my labour of love,\" not the l", "east among these being\nthose publishers, who, with a generous and prompt alacrity, gave me\npermissio", "n to make extracts, excerpts, notes, and quotations from the\nfollowing high-class works, their prope", "rty.

They were discovered ", "by an Egyptian fellah,\nemployed in husbandry, who tumbled into a pit which, on further\nexamination, ", "proved to be a large subterranean cave completely filled\nwith mummy Cats, every one of which had bee", "n separately embalmed and\nwrapped in cloth, after the manner of the Egyptian human mummies, all\nbein", "g laid out carefully in rows; and here they had lain probably about\nthree or four thousand years. Th", "e \"totem\" of a section of the ancients,\nas is well known, was the Cat; hence when a Cat died it was ", "buried with\ndue honours, being embalmed, and often decorated in various ways, and,\nin short, had as ", "much attention paid to it as a human being. It had long\nbeen believed that a Cat cemetery existed on", " the east bank of the Nile,\nand in the autumn of 1889 the lucky Egyptian, about 100 miles from\nCairo", ", came unexpectedly upon it.\n\nImmediately on \"the find\" becoming known, \"specimen\" mummy Cats were\nw", "ritten for to agents in Egypt, one friend of mine sending for four, and\nit appeared for a while that", " much money would be realised by the owner\nof the cave or land in this way; but the number was too g", "reat, and the\nprices and the interest gave way, and, sad to relate, these former\n\"Deities\" were dug ", "out of their resting-place by hundreds of thousands,\nand quickly sold to local farmers, being used f", "or enriching the land.\nOther lots found their way to an Alexandrian merchant, and were by him\nsent t", "o Liverpool on board the steamer _Pharos and Thebes_.\n\nThe consignment consisted of 19\u00bd tons, and we", "re sold by auction, mostly\nbeing bought by a local \"fertiliser\" merchant. The auction was only\nknown", " to the trade, and the lots were \"knocked down\" at the \"giving\naway\" sums of \u00a33 13_s._ 9_d._, \u00a33 17_", "s._, to \u00a34 5_s._ _per ton_, the big\nand the perfect ones being picked out for the museum and private", "\ncollections. The broker who sold used a head of one of these Cats in\nlieu of an auctioneer's hammer", ". And now these tons of \"deified\" Cats are\nused for manure, and in our English soil plants grow into", " them, and on\nthem, and of them; and, if it be true, as chemists assert, these plants\ntake into thei", "r system that on which they feed, and so, if so, possibly\nin our very bread that we have eaten, we h", "ave swallowed \"_a little_ at a\ntime part of if not the whole of a deified cat.\"\n\nI made several ende", "avours to find out from those on the spot at\nLiverpool whether there was any hair of colours in exis", "tence among the\nmass of bodies; but in no case could I succeed in getting any, as I had\nhoped by thi", "s means to possibly come to some conclusion as to the kind\nor breed. Of course, it is well known fro", "m mummies long in this country\nwhat form, size, and general appearance the Egyptian possessed; but a", "s\nyet, as far as I can learn, no one has found so much, if any, of the fur\nas to be able to determin", "e the colour.\n\nApropos with the above, as applying the bodies of the mummy Cats for\nmanure, comes th", "e modern idea of keeping Cats for their fur. It is\nstated that a company has been formed in America ", "for that purpose in\nWashington, and an island of some size has been bought or leased for\nthe purpose", ". The intention is to raise entirely black Cats; and as their\nplace of abode will be surrounded by w", "ater, it is conjectured that after\nthe first importation they will go on propagating and producing o", "nly\nCats of that beautiful though sombre dark hue. The Cats with which the\nisland is to be stocked a", "re to be procured from Holland, where already\nthe \"industry\" is \"at work.\" So much so that a friend ", "of mine, an\nelderly gentleman, sending to a furrier in Holland to know what kind of\nfur he would rec", "ommend as the best for warmth, received the reply that\nCats' skins \"were the most useful and warmest", ".\" A few days ago he called\non me wrapped in a cloth coat, with fur collar and cuffs, and _lining\nth", "roughout of black Cats' skins_, and I am bound to say that the general\nappearance was much in its fa", "vour; he also stated that he was in every\nway perfectly satisfied.\n\nBy-the-bye, the Cat Company inte", "nd to feed their Cats on fish, which\nabound about the shores of their island, and so they affirm the", " food\nwill cost nothing, and their profits consequently be very large. But in\nthis I hope they have ", "been well informed as to the adaptability of the\nCat to feed _entirely_ on fish, for of this I have ", "my doubts; certainly\nthose I have had did not appear to thrive if they had fish too often.\n\nAgain, a", "s the Cats are to roam the island at their \"own sweet will,\" I\ntake it there will be at times some \"", "damaging of fur\" by the playful way\nin which they so often engage, when jealousy incites them to mor", "tal\ncombat. But possibly this has been considered and duly entered in the\n\"profit and loss\" account.", "\n\nWhile writing that portion of my book in which I referred to the\nsuperstitions connected with the ", "domestic Cat, and the amazing stories\ntold of the witches' Cats, I felt convinced that in those dark", "ened and\nfoolish times that the very fact of the wonderful faculty the Cat\npossesses of applying wha", "t it observes to its own purposes was in some\nway the cause of the ignorant and superstitious consid", "ering that it was\n\"possessed\" of an evil spirit. I therefore searched for proofs among the\nevidence ", "given at the trial of witches, and was, as I expected, rewarded\nfor my trouble. What a Cat would do ", "now would not unreasonably be\nthought clever and showing much sagacity, if not attributes of a deepe", "r\nkind.\n\nYet I find that at a trial for witchcraft, the following questions were\nput to a man: \"Well", "! and what did you see?\" \"Well! I saw her Cat walk up\nand try to open the door by the latch.\" \"What ", "did you do?\" \"I\nimmediately killed it.\" This, which is now regarded as an everyday\nexample of the in", "telligence of the Cat, bore hardly in the evidence\nagainst the witch. Sir Walter Scott, in his lette", "r on \"Demonology and\nWitchcraft,\" tells of \"a poor old woman condemned, as usual, on her own\nconfess", "ion, and on the testimony of a neighbour, who deposed that he saw\na Cat jump in the accused person's", " cottage through the window at\ntwilight, one evening, and that he verily believed the Cat to be the\n", "devil, on which precious testimony the poor wretch was hanged.\" One more\nnote and I leave the subjec", "t. A certain carpenter, named William\nMontgomery, was so infested with Cats, which, as his servant-m", "aid\nreported, \"spoke among themselves,\" that he fell in a rage upon a party\nof these animals, which ", "had assembled in his house at irregular hours,\nand betwixt his Highland arms of knife, dirk, and bro", "adsword, and his\nprofessional weapon of an axe, he made such a dispersion that they were\nquiet for t", "he night. In consequence of his blows _two witches_ are said\nto have died.\n\nSince writing of the Eng", "lish wild Cat, I had the pleasure of meeting Mr.\nFrancis Darwin (brother of Mr. Charles Darwin) on b", "oard the steamboat\ngoing to St. Servan, when, in the course of conversation, he informed me\nthat a w", "ild Cat was killed at Bramhope Moor Plantation, in 1841, a\nkeeper having caught it in _two_ traps.\n\n", "In February of this year, 1891, my kind friend, Mr. Dresser, of\nOrpington, the well-known naturalist", ", wrote to me to know whether I\nwould like to have a kitten half-bred between the British Wild Cat a", "nd a\ndomestic she Cat, which I was unfortunately obliged to decline, fearing\nit would \"make matters ", "unpleasant\" with what I had. He very kindly\nsupplied me with the following particulars forwarded to ", "him by O. H.\nMactheyer, Esq.: \"Mr. Harrison Weir can see the papa of the kitten at\nthe Zoo.\n\n\"He is ", "a young Cat (under a year old, we thought, by the teeth). He was\nseen one moonlight night in company", " with my 'stalker's' small lean black\nCat, right away in my deer forest. We caught the papa in a tra", "p after he\nhad killed a number of grouse, and not being badly hurt, I sent him to\nBartlett at the Zo", "o. We are thoroughly up to real wild Cats here. I have\ncaught them forty-three inches from nose to t", "ail-end; tails as thick at\nthe point as at the root; the ears are also differently set on. Martin\nCa", "ts, Polecats, and Badgers are all extinct here, and it is ten years\nsince we got the last wild Cat, ", "but three have been killed in this\ndistrict this winter.\"\n\nI insert the foregoing as being of much i", "nterest, it having been\nfrequently stated that the wild Cat will not mate with the domestic Cat.\nThe", " kitten offered to me is now at Fawley Court, Bucks.\n\nAmong the numerous letters I have received fro", "m America is one from Mrs.\nMary A. C. Livermore, of Cambridge, Mass., U.S.A., who writes: \"I have\nju", "st come possessed of a black long-haired Cat from Maine. It is neither\nPersian, Angora, nor Indian. ", "They are called here 'Coon' Cats, and it is\nvulgarly supposed to be a cross between a common Cat and", " a 'Coon.' Mine\nis a rusty bear-brown colour, but his relatives have been black and\nwhite, blue and ", "white, and fawn and white, the latter the gentlest,\nprettiest Cat I know. His tail is very bushy and", " a fine ruff adorns his\nneck. A friend of mine has a pair of these Cats, all black, and the\nfemale c", "onsorts with no one but her mate. Yet often she has in her\nlitter a common short-haired kitten.\"\n\nSi", "nce the above reached me, I have received from another correspondent\nin the United States a very bea", "utiful photograph of what is termed a\n\"Coon\" Cat. It certainly differs much from the ordinary long-h", "aired Cat\nin appearance; but as to its being a cross with the Racoon, such a\nsupposition is totally ", "out of the question, and the idea cannot be\nentertained. The photographs sent to me show that the ea", "rs are unusually\nlarge, the head long, the length being in excess from the eyes to the\ntip of the no", "se, the legs and feet are large and evenly covered with\nlong, somewhat coarse hair, the latter being", " devoid of tufts between and\nat the extremity of the toes; there are no long hairs of any consequenc", "e\neither within the ears or at their apex. The frill or mane is\nconsiderable, as is the length of th", "e hair covering the body; the tail\nis rather short and somewhat thick, well covered with hair of equ", "al\nlength, and in shape like a fox's brush. The eyes are large, round, and\nfull, with a wild staring", " expression. Certainly, the breed, however it\nmay be obtained, is most interesting to the Cat natura", "list, and the\ncolour, as before stated, being peculiar, must of course attract his\nattention indepen", "dently of its general appearance.\n\nSince the above was written, I have received the following from M", "r.\nHenry Brooker, The Elms, West Midford, Massachusetts, United States of\nAmerica. After asking for ", "information respecting Cats of certain breeds,\nhe says: \"I have had for a number of years a peculiar", " strain of\nlong-haired Cats; they come from the islands off the coast of Maine, and\nare known in thi", "s country as 'Coon' Cats. The belief is that they have\nbeen crossed with the 'Coon.' This, of course", ", is untrue. The\ninhabitants of these islands are seafaring people, and many years ago\nsome one on h", "is vessel had a pair of long-haired Cats from which the\nstrain has sprung. There are few short-haire", "d cats on the island as\nthere is no communication with the mainland except by boat. I want to\nimprov", "e my strain and get finer hair than the Cats now have. Yellow Cats\nare the most popular kind here, a", "nd I have succeeded in producing Cats\nof a rich mahogany colour with brushes like a fox. They hunt i", "n the\nfields with me, and my Scotch terriers and they are on the most friendly\nterms.\" This, as a co", "rroboration of the foregoing letters and the\nphotographs, is, I take it, eminently satisfactory.\n\nI ", "have been shown a Siberian Cat, by Mr. Castang, of Leadenhall Market;\nthe breed is entirely new to m", "e. It is a small female Cat of a\nslaty-blue colour, rather short in body and legs; the head is small", " and\nmuch rounded, while the ears are of medium size. The iris of the eyes is\na deep golden colour, ", "which, in contrast to the bluish colour of the\nfur, makes them to appear still more brilliant; the t", "ail is short and\nthick, very much so at the base, and suddenly pointed at the tip. It is\nparticularl", "y timid and wild in its nature, and is difficult to approach;\nbut, as Mr. Castang observed, this tim", "idity may be \"because it does not\nunderstand our language and does not know when it is called or spo", "ken\nto.\" I think it would make a valuable Cat to cross with some English\nvarieties.\n\nA correspondent", " writes: \"In your book on Cats you do not mention\nNorwegian Cats. I was in Norway last year, and was", " struck by the Cats\nbeing different to any I had ever seen, being much stouter built, with\nthick clo", "se fur, mostly sandy, with stripes of dark yellow.\" I suppose I\nam to infer that both the sexes are ", "of sandy yellow colour. If so, I\nshould say it is more a matter of selection than a new colour. I fi", "nd\ngenerally in the colder countries the fur is short, dense, and somewhat\nwoolly, and as a rule, ju", "dging from the information that I am\ncontinually receiving, whole or entire colours predominate.\n\nLa", "rge Cats are by some sought after. This, I take it, is a great\nmistake, the fairly medium-sized Cat ", "being much the handsomer of the\ntwo, and they are generally also devoid of that coarseness that is f", "ound\napparent in the former; while small Cats are extremely pretty, and I\nunderstand are not only li", "kely to be \"in vogue,\" but are actually now\nbeing bred for their extreme _prettiness_. I have heard ", "of some of these\n\"Bantam\" Cats being produced by that true and most excellent fancier,\nMr. Herbert Y", "oung, who not only has produced a Tortoiseshell Tom Cat on\nlines laid down by myself, but is also en", "gaged in breeding more, and I\nhave not the least doubt he will be most successful, he having so been", "\nin producing new colours and some of the finest silver tabby\nshort-haired Cats as yet seen; these s", "hort-haired Cats, in my opinion,\nfar surpassing for beauty any long-hair ever exhibited, and are\ncer", "tainly of a \"sweeter disposition.\"\n\nIn my former edition of \"Our Cats,\" I wrote hopefully and expect", "antly of\nmuch good to be derived from the institution of the so-called National\nCat Club, and of whi", "ch I was then President; but I am sorry to say that\nnone of those hopes or expectations have been re", "alised, and I now feel\nthe _deepest regret_ that I was ever induced to be in any way associated\nwith", " it. I do not care to go into particulars further than to say I\nfound the principal idea of many of ", "its members consisted not so much in\npromoting the welfare of the Cat as of winning prizes, and more", "\nparticularly their own Cat Club medals, for which, though offered at\npublic shows, the public were ", "not allowed to compete, and when won by\nthe members, in many cases the public were thoughtlessly mis", "led by\nbelieving it was an open competition. I therefore felt it my duty to\nleave the club for that ", "and other reasons. I have also left off judging\nof the Cats, even at my old much-loved show at the C", "rystal Palace,\nbecause I no longer cared to come into contact with _such_ \"Lovers of\nCats.\"\n\nI am ve", "ry much in favour of the Cats' Homes.

One asks: \"What is a true tortoiseshell\nlike?\" Another: \"What is a tab", "by?\" and yet another: \"What is a blue\ntabby?\" One writes of the \"splendid disposition\" of his cat, a", "nother\nasks how to cure a cat scratching the furniture, and so on.\n\nAfter much consideration, and al", "so at the request of many, I have\nthought it best to publish my notes on cats, their ways, habits,\ni", "nstincts, peculiarities, usefulness, colours, markings, forms, and\nother qualities that are required", " as fitting subjects to exhibit at what\nis now one of the instituted exhibitions of \"The land we liv", "e in,\" and\nalso the Folk and other lore, both ancient and modern, respecting them.\n\nIt is many years", " ago that, when thinking of the large number of cats\nkept in London alone, I conceived the idea that", " it would be well to\nhold \"Cat Shows,\" so that the different breeds, colours, markings, etc.,\nmight ", "be more carefully attended to, and the domestic cat, sitting in\nfront of the fire, would then posses", "s a beauty and an attractiveness to\nits owner unobserved and unknown because uncultivated heretofore", ".\nPrepossessed with this view of the subject, I called on my friend Mr.\nWilkinson, the then manager ", "of the Crystal Palace. With his usual\nbusinesslike clear-headedness, he saw it was \"a thing to be do", "ne.\" In a\nfew days I presented my scheme in full working order: the schedule of\nprizes, the price of", " entry, the number of classes, and the points by\nwhich they would be judged, the number of prizes in", " each class, their\namount, the different varieties of colour, form, size, and sex for which\nthey wer", "e to be given; I also made a drawing of the head of a cat to be\nprinted in black on yellow paper for", " a posting bill. Mr. F. Wilson, the\nCompany's naturalist and show manager, then took the matter in c", "harge,\nworked hard, got a goodly number of cats together, among which was my\nblue tabby, \"The Old La", "dy,\" then about fourteen years old, yet the best\nin the show of its colour and never surpassed, thou", "gh lately possibly\nequalled. To my watch-chain I have attached the silver bell she wore at\nher _d\u00e9bu", "t_.\n\nMy brother, John Jenner Weir, the Rev. J. Macdona, and myself acted as\njudges, and the result w", "as a success far beyond our most sanguine\nexpectations--so much so that I having made it a labour of", " love of the\nfeline race, and acting \"without fee, gratuity, or reward,\" the Crystal\nPalace Company ", "generously presented me with a large silver tankard in\ntoken of their high approval of my exertions ", "on behalf of \"the Company,\"\nand--Cats. Now that a Cat Club is formed, shows are more numerous, and\nt", "he entries increasing, there is every reason to expect a permanent\nbenefit in every way to one of th", "e most intelligent of (though often\nmuch abused) animals.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nTHE FIRST CAT SHOW.\n\n\n", "On the day for judging, at Ludgate Hill I took a ticket and the train\nfor the Crystal Palace. Sittin", "g alone in the comfortable cushioned\ncompartment of a \"first class,\" I confess I felt somewhat more ", "than\nanxious as to the issue of the experiment. Yes; what would it be like?\nWould there be many cats", "? How many? How would the animals comport\nthemselves in their cages? Would they sulk or cry for libe", "rty, refuse\nall food? or settle down and take the situation quietly and resignedly,\nor give way to t", "error? I could in no way picture to myself the scene; it\nwas all so new. Presently, and while I was ", "musing on the subject, the\ndoor was opened, and a friend got in. \"Ah!\" said he, \"how are you?\"\n\"Tole", "rably well,\" said I; \"I am on my way to the Cat Show.\" \"What!\"\nsaid my friend, \"that surpasses every", "thing! A show of cats! Why, I hate\nthe things; I drive them off my premises when I see them. You'll ", "have a\nfine bother with them in their cages! Or are they to be tied up? Anyhow,\nwhat a noise there w", "ill be, and how they will clutch at the bars and try\nand get out, or they will strangle themselves w", "ith their chains.\" \"I am\nsorry, very sorry,\" said I, \"that you do not like cats. For my part, I\nthin", "k them extremely beautiful, also very graceful in all their actions,\nand they are quite as domestic ", "in their habits as the dog, if not more\nso. They are very useful in catching rats and mice; they are", " not\ndeficient in sense; they will jump up at doors to push up latches with\ntheir paws. I have known", " them knock at a door by the knocker when\nwanting admittance. They know Sunday from the week-day, an", "d do not go\nout to wait for the meat barrow on that day; they----\" \"Stop,\" said my\nfriend, \"I see yo", "u do like cats, and I do not, so let the matter drop.\"\n\"No,\" said I, \"not so. That is why I institut", "ed this Cat Show; I wish\nevery one to see how beautiful a well-cared-for cat is, and how docile,\ngen", "tle, and--may I use the term?--cossetty. Why should not the cat that\nsits purring in front of us bef", "ore the fire be an object of interest,\nand be selected for its colour, markings, and form? Now come ", "with me, my\ndear old friend, and see the first Cat Show.\"\n\nInside the Crystal Palace stood my friend", " and I. Instead of the noise\nand struggles to escape, there lay the cats in their different pens,\nre", "clining on crimson cushions, making no sound save now and then a\nhomely purring, as from time to tim", "e they lapped the nice new milk\nprovided for them. Yes, there they were, big cats, very big cats,\nmi", "ddling-sized cats, and small cats, cats of all colours and markings,\nand beautiful pure white Persia", "n cats; and as we passed down the front\nof the cages I saw that my friend became interested; present", "ly he said:\n\"What a beauty this is! and here's another!\" \"And no doubt,\" said I,\n\"many of the cats y", "ou have seen before would be quite as beautiful if\nthey were as well cared for, or at least cared fo", "r at all; generally\nthey are driven about and ill-fed, and often ill-used, simply for the\nreason tha", "t they are cats, and for no other. Yet I feel a great pleasure\nin telling you the show would have be", "en much larger were it not for the\ndifficulty of inducing the owners to send their pets from home, t", "hough\nyou see the great care that is taken of them.\" \"Well, I had no idea\nthere was such a variety o", "f form, size, and colour,\" said my friend, and\ndeparted. A few months after, I called on him; he was", " at luncheon, with\ntwo cats on a chair beside him--pets I should say, from their\nappearance.\n\n[Illus", "tration]\n\nThis is not a solitary instance of the good of the first Cat Show in\nleading up to the obs", "ervation of, and kindly feeling for, the domestic\ncat. Since then, throughout the length and breadth", " of the land there\nhave been Cat Shows, and much interest is taken in them by all classes\nof the com", "munity, so much so that large prices have been paid for\nhandsome specimens. It is to be hoped that b", "y these shows the too often\ndespised cat will meet with the attention and kind treatment that every\n", "dumb animal should have and ought to receive at the hands of humanity.\nEven the few instances of the", " shows generating a love for cats that have\ncome before my own notice are a sufficient pleasure to m", "e not to regret\nhaving thought out and planned the first Cat Show at the Crystal\nPalace.\n\n[Illustrat", "ion]\n\n\n\n\nHABITS.\n\n\nBefore attempting to describe the different varieties, I should like to\nmake a fe", "w remarks as to the habits and ways of \"the domestic cat.\"\n\nWhen judging, I have frequently found so", "me of the exhibits of anything\nbut a mild and placid disposition. Some have displayed a downright\nfe", "rocity; others, on the contrary, have been excessively gentle, and\nvery few but seemed to recognise ", "their position, and submitted quietly\nto their confinement. This is easily accounted for when person", "s are\naccustomed to cats; they know what wonderful powers of observation the\ncat possesses, and how ", "quickly they recognise the \"why and the\nwherefore\" of many things. Take for instance, how very _many", "_ cats will\nopen a _latched_ door by springing up and holding on with one fore-leg\nwhile with the ot", "her they press down the latch catch, and so open the\ndoor; and yet even more observant are they than", " that, as I have shown by\na case in my \"Animal Stories, Old and New,\" in which a cat opened a\ndoor b", "y pulling it _towards_ him, when he found _pushing_ it of no\navail. The cat is more critical in noti", "cing than the dog. I never knew\nbut one dog that would open a door by moving the fastening without b", "eing\nshown or taught how to do it. Cats that have done so are numberless. I\nnoticed one at the last ", "Crystal Palace Show, a white cat: it looked up,\nit looked down, then to the right and then a little ", "to the left, paused,\nseemed lost in thought, when, not seeing any one about, it crept up to\nthe door", ", and with its paw tried to pull back the bolt or catch. On\ngetting sight of me, it retired to a cor", "ner of the cage, shut its eyes,\nand pretended to sleep. I stood further away, and soon saw the paw\nc", "oming through the bars again. This cat had noticed how the cage-door\nwas fastened, and so knew how t", "o open it.\n\nMany cats that are said to be spiteful are made so by ill-treatment,\nfor, as a rule, I h", "ave found them to be most affectionate and gentle,\nand that to the last degree, attaching themselves", " to individuals,\nalthough such is stated not to be the case, yet of this I am certain.\nHaving had se", "veral in my house at one time, I found that no two were the\n\"followers\" of the same member of my fam", "ily. But it may be argued, and I\nthink with some degree of justice, Why was this? Was it only that e", "ach\ncat had a separate liking? If so, why? Why should not three or four cats\ntake a liking to the sa", "me individual? But they seldom or never do, and\nfor that matter there seems somewhat the same feelin", "g with dogs. This\nrequired some consideration, but that not of long duration. For I am\nsorry to say ", "I rapidly came to the conclusion that it was jealousy. Yes,\njealousy! There was no doubt of it. Zeno", " would be very cossetty, loving,\nlovable, and gentle, but when Lulu came in and was nursed he retire", "d to\na corner and seized the first opportunity of vanishing through the door.\nAs soon as Zillah jump", "ed on my knee and put her paws about my neck, Lulu\nlooked at me, then at her, then at me, walked to ", "the fire, sat down,\nlooked round, got up, went to the door, cried to go out, the door was\nopened, an", "d----she fled. I thought that Zillah seemed then more than\never--happy.\n\nThough jealousy is one of i", "f not the ruling attributes of the cat, there\nare exceptions to such a rule. Sometimes it may be tha", "t two or more will\ntake to the same person. As an instance of this I had two cats, one a\nred tabby, ", "a great beauty; Lillah, a short-haired red-and-white cat; the\nlatter and a white long-haired one, na", "med \"The Colonel,\" were great\nfriends, and these associated with a tortoiseshell-and-white, Lizzie.\n", "None of these were absolutely house cats, but attended more to the\npoultry yards and runs, looking a", "fter the chicken, seeing that no rats\nwere about or other \"vermin,\" near the coops. Useful cats, ver", "y!\n\nMine was then a very large garden, and generally of an evening, when at\nhome, I used to walk abo", "ut the numerous paths to admire the beauties of\nthe different herbaceous plants, of which I had an i", "nteresting\ncollection. Five was my time of starting on my ambulation, when, on\ngoing out of the door", ", I was sure to find the two first-named cats, and\noften the third, waiting for me, ready to go wher", "ever I went, following\nlike faithful dogs. These apparently never had any jealous feeling.\n\nOf all t", "he cats Lillah was the most loving. If I stood still, she would\nlook up, and watch the expression of", " my face. If she thought it was\nfavourable to her, she would jump, and, clinging to my chest, put he", "r\nfore-paws around my neck, and rub her head softly against my face,\npurring melodiously all the tim", "e, then move on to my shoulder, while\n\"The Colonel\" and his tortoiseshell friend Lizzie would press ", "about my\nlegs, uttering the same musical self-complacent sound. Here, there, and\neverywhere, even ou", "t into the road or into the wood, the pretty things\nwould accompany me, seeming intensely happy. Whe", "n I returned to the\nhouse, they would scamper off, bounding in the air, and playing with and\ntumblin", "g over each other in the fullest and most frolicsome manner\nimaginable. No! I do not think that Lill", "ah, The Colonel, or Lizzie ever\nknew the feeling of jealousy. But these, as I said before, were\nexce", "ptions. They all had a sad ending, coming to an untimely death\nthrough being caught in wires set by ", "poachers for rabbits. I have ever\nregretted the loss of the gentle Lillah. She was as beautiful as s", "he was\ngood, gentle, and loving, without a fault.\n\nIt may have been noted in the foregoing I have sa", "id that my cats were\nalways awaiting my coming. Just so. The cat seems to take note of time\nas well ", "as place. At my town house I had a cat named Guadalquiver, which\nwas fed on horseflesh brought to th", "e door. Every day during the week he\nwould go and sit ready for the coming of \"the cat's-meat man,\" ", "but he\nnever did so on the Sunday. How it was he knew on that day that the man\ndid not come I never ", "could discover; still, the fact remains. How he, or\nwhether he, counted the days until the sixth, an", "d then rested the\nseventh from his watching, is a mystery. A similar case is related of an\nanimal be", "longing to Mr. Tr\u00fcbner, the London publisher. The cat, a\ngigantic one, and a pet of his, used to go ", "every evening to the end of\nthe terrace, on which was the house where he resided, to escort Mr.\nTr\u00fcb", "ner back to dinner on his arrival from the City, but was never once\nknown to make the mistake of goi", "ng to meet him on Sundays. And again,\nhow well a cat knows when it is luncheon-time! He or she may b", "e\napparently asleep on the tiles, or snugly lying under a bush basking in\nthe sun's warm rays, when ", "it will look up, yawn, stretch itself, get up,\nand move leisurely towards the house, and as the lunc", "heon-bell rings, in\nwalks the cat, as ready for food as any there.\n\nMost cats are of a gentle dispos", "ition, but resent ill-treatment in a\nmost determined way, generally making use of their claws, at th", "e same\ntime giving vent to their feelings by a low growl and spitting\nfuriously. Under such conditio", "ns it is best to leave off that which has\nappeared to irritate them. Dogs generally bite when they l", "ose their\ntemper, but a cat seldom. Should a cat dig her claws into your hand,\nnever draw it backwar", "d, but push forward; you thus close the foot and\nrender the claws harmless. If otherwise, you genera", "lly lose three to\nfour pieces of skin from your hand; the cat knows he has done it, and\nfeels reveng", "ed. Some cats do not like their ears touched, others their\nbacks, others their tails. I have one now", " (Fritz); he has such a great\ndislike to having his tail touched that if we only point to it and say", "\n\"Tail!\" he growls, and if repeated he will get up and go out of the\nroom, even though he was enjoyi", "ng the comfort of his basket before a\ngood fire. By avoiding anything that is known to tease an anim", "al, no\nmatter what, it will be found that is the true way, combined with gentle\ntreatment and oft ca", "ressing, to tame and to make them love you, even\nthose whose temper is none of the best. This is equ", "ally applicable to\nhorses, cows, and dogs as to cats. Gentleness and kindness will work\nwonders with", " animals, and, I take it, is not lost on human beings.\n\nThe distance cats will travel to find and re", "gain the home they have been\ntaken from is surprising. One my groom begged of me, as he said he had\n", "no cat at home, and he was fond of \"the dear thing,\" but he really\nwanted to be rid of it, as I foun", "d afterwards. He took the poor animal\naway in a hamper, and after carrying it some three miles throu", "gh London\nstreets, threw it into the Surrey Canal. That cat was sitting wet and\ndirty outside the st", "able when he came in the morning, and went in\njoyfully on his opening the door, ran up to and climbe", "d on to the back\nof its favourite, the horse, who neighed a \"welcome home.\" The man left\nthat week.\n", "\nAnother instance, and I could give many more, but this will suffice. It\nis said that if you wish an", " old cat to stay you should have the mother\nwith the kitten or kittens, but this sometimes fails to ", "keep her. Having\na fancy for a beautiful brown tabby, I purchased her and kitten from a\ncottager liv", "ing two miles and a half away. The next day I let her out,\nkeeping the kitten in a basket before the", " fire. In half an hour mother\nand child were gone, and though she had to carry her little one throug", "h\nwoods, hedgerows, across grass and arable fields, she arrived home with\nher young charge quite saf", "ely the following day, though evidently very\ntired, wet, and hungry. After two days she was brought ", "back, and being\nwell fed and carefully tended, she roamed no more.\n\nThe cat, like many other animals", ", will often form singular attachments.\nOne would sit in my horse's manger and purr and rub against ", "his nose,\nwhich undoubtedly the horse enjoyed, for he would frequently turn his\nhead purposely to be", " so treated. One went as consort with a Dorking\ncock; another took a great liking to my collie, Rove", "r; another loved\nLina, the cow; while another would cosset up close to a sitting hen, and\nallowed th", "e fresh-hatched chickens to seek warmth by creeping under her.\nAgain, they will rear other animals s", "uch as rats, rabbits, squirrels,\npuppies, hedgehogs; and, when motherly inclined, will take to almos", "t\nanything, even to a young pigeon.\n\nAt the Brighton Show of 1886 there were two cats, both reared b", "y dogs,\nthe foster-mother and her bantling showing evident signs of sincere\naffection.\n\nThere are bo", "th men and women who have a decided antipathy to\ncats--\"Won't have one in the house on any account.\"", " They are called\n\"deceitful,\" and some go as far as to say \"treacherous,\" but how and in\nwhat way I ", "cannot discover. Others, on the contrary, love cats beyond\nall other \"things domestic.\" Of course ca", "ts, like other animals, or even\nhuman beings, are very dissimilar, no two being precisely alike in\nd", "isposition, any more than are to be found two forms so closely\nresembling as not to be distinguished", " one from the other. To some a cat\nis a cat, and if all were black all would be alike. But this woul", "d not\nbe so in reality, as those well know who are close observers of animal\nand bird life. Of cours", "e the gamekeeper has a dislike to cats, more\nespecially when they \"take to the woods,\" but so long a", "s they are fed,\nand keep within bounds, they are \"useful\" in scaring away rats from the\nyoung broods", " of pheasants. What are termed \"poaching cats\" are clearly\n\"outlaws,\" and must be treated as such.\n\n", "\n\n\nTRAINED CATS.\n\n\nThat cats may be trained to respect the lives of other animals, and also\nbirds on", " which they habitually feed, is a well-known fact. In proof of\nthis I well recollect a story that my", " father used to tell of \"a happy\nfamily\" that was shown many years ago on the Surrey side of Waterlo", "o\nBridge. Their abode consisted of a large wire cage placed on wheels. In\nwindy weather the \"breezy ", "side\" was protected by green baize, so\ndraughts were prevented, and a degree of comfort obtained. As", " there was\nno charge for \"the show,\" a box was placed in front with an opening for\nthe purpose of ad", "mitting any donations from those who felt inclined to\ngive. On it was written \"The Happy Family--the", "ir money-box.\" The family\nvaried somewhat, as casualties occurred occasionally by death from\nnatural", " causes or sales. Usually, there was a Monkey, an Owl, some\nGuinea-pigs, Squirrels, small birds, Sta", "rlings, a Magpie, Rats, Mice,\nand a Cat or two. But the story? Well, the story is this. One day, whe", "n\nmy father was looking at \"the happy family,\" a burly-looking man came\nup, and, after a while, said", " to the man who owned the show: \"Ah! I don't\nsee much in that. It is true the cat does not touch the", " small birds [one\nof which was sitting on the head of the cat at the time], nor the other\nthings; bu", "t you could not manage to keep rats and mice in there as\nwell.\" \"Think not?\" said the showman. \"I th", "ink I could very easily.\"\n\"Not you,\" said the burly one. \"I will give you a month to do it in, if\nyo", "u like, and a shilling in the bargain if you succeed. I shall be this\nway again soon.\" \"Thank you, s", "ir,\" said the man. \"Don't go yet,\" then,\nputting a stick through the bars of the cage he lifted up t", "he cat, when\nfrom beneath her out ran a white rat and three white mice.\n\"Won--der--ful!\" slowly ejac", "ulated he of the burly form; \"Wonder--ful!\"\nThe money was paid.\n\nCats, properly trained, will not to", "uch anything, alive or dead, on the\npremises to which they are attached. I have known them to sport ", "with\ntame rabbits, to romp and jump in frolicsome mood this way, then that,\nwhich both seemed greatl", "y to enjoy, yet they would bring home wild\nrabbits they had killed, and not touch my little chickens", " or ducklings.\n\n[Illustration: \"THE OLD LADY.\"]\n\nWhen I built a house in the country, fond as I am o", "f cats, I determined\n_not_ to keep any there, because they would destroy the birds' nests and\ndrive ", "my feathered friends away, and I liked to watch and feed these\nfrom the windows. Things went pleasan", "tly for awhile. The birds were fed,\nand paid for their keep with many and many a song. There were th", "e old\nones and there the young, and oft by the hour I watched them from the\nwindow; and they became ", "so tame as scarcely caring to get out of my way\nwhen I went outside with more food. But--there is al", "ways a but--but one\nday, or rather evening, as I was \"looking on,\" a rat came out from the\nrocks, an", "d then another. Soon they began their repast on the remains of\nthe birds' food. Then in the twilight", " came mice, the short-tailed and\nthe long, scampering hither and thither. This, too, was amusing. In", " the\nautumn I bought some filberts, and put them into a closet upstairs, went\nto London, returned, a", "nd thought I would sleep in the room adjoining the\ncloset. No such thing. As soon as the light was o", "ut there was a sound of\ngnawing--curb--curb--sweek!--squeak--a rushing of tiny feet here, there,\nand", " everywhere; thump, bump--scriggle, scraggle--squeak--overhead, above\nthe ceiling, behind the skirti", "ng boards, under the floor, and--in the\ncloset. I lighted a candle, opened the door, and looked into", " the\nrepository for my filberts. What a hustling, what a scuffling, what a\nscrambling. There they we", "re, mice in numbers; they \"made for\" some holes\nin the corners of the cupboard, got jammed, squeaked", ", struggled,\nsquabbled, pushed, their tails making circles; push--push--squeak!--more\njostling, anot", "her effort or two--squeak--squeak--gurgle--squeak--more\nstruggling--and they were gone. Gone? Yes! b", "ut not for long. As soon as\nthe light was out back they came. No! oh, dear no! sleep! no more sleep.", "\nOutside, I liked to watch the mice; but when they climbed the ivy and\ngot inside, the pleasure enti", "rely ceased. Nor was this all; they got\ninto the vineries and spoilt the grapes, and the rats killed", " the young\nducks and chickens, and undermined the building also, besides storing\nquantities of grain", " and other things under the floor. The result number\none was, three cats coming on a visit. Farmyard", " cats--cats that knew the\ndifference between chickens, ducklings, mice, and rats. Result number\ntwo,", " that after being away a couple of weeks, I went again to my\ncottage, and I slept undisturbed in the", " room late the play-ground of the\nmice. My chickens and ducklings were safe, and soon the cats allow", "ed the\nbirds to be fed in front of the window, though I could not break them of\ndestroying many of t", "he nests. I never NOTICED more fully the very great\nuse the domestic cat is to man than on that occa", "sion. All day my cats\nwere indoors, dozy, sociable, and contented. At night they were on guard\noutsi", "de, and doubtless saved me the lives of dozens of my \"young\nthings.\" One afternoon I saw one of my c", "ats coming towards me with\napparent difficulty in walking. On its near approach I found it was\ncarry", "ing a large rat, which appeared dead. Coming nearer, the cat put\ndown the rat. Presently I saw it mo", "ve, then it suddenly got up and ran\noff. The cat caught it again. Again it feigned death, again got ", "up and\nran off, and was once more caught. It laid quite still, when, perceiving\nthe cat had turned a", "way, it got up, apparently quite uninjured, and ran\nin another direction, and I and the cat--lost it", "! I was not sorry. This\nrat deserved his liberty. Whether it was permanent I know not, as\n\"Little-jo", "hn,\" the cat, remained, and I left.\n\nThe cat is not only a very useful animal about the house and pr", "emises,\nbut is also ornamental. It is lithe and beautiful in form, and graceful\nin action. Of course", " there are cats that are ugly by comparison with\nothers, both in form, colour, and markings; and as ", "there are now cat\nshows, at which prizes are offered for varieties, I will endeavour to\ngive, in suc", "ceeding chapters, the points of excellence as regards form,\ncolour, and markings required and most e", "steemed for the different\nclasses. I am the more induced to define these as clearly as possible,\nowi", "ng to the number of mistakes that often occur in the entries.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nLONG-HAIRED CATS.\n", "\n\nThese are very diversified, both in form, colour, and the quality of the\nhair, which in some is mo", "re woolly than in others; and they vary also in\nthe shape and length of the tail, the ears, and size", " of eyes. There are\nseveral varieties--the Russian, the Angora, the Persian, and Indian.\nForty or fi", "fty years ago they used all to be called French cats, as they\nwere mostly imported from Paris--more ", "particularly the white, which were\nthen the fashion, and, if I remember rightly, they, as a rule, we", "re\nlarger than those of the present day. Coloured long-haired cats were\nthen rare, and but little ca", "red for or appreciated. The pure white, with\nlong silky hair, bedecked with blue or rose-colour ribb", "on, or a silver\ncollar with its name inscribed thereon or one of scarlet leather studded\nwith brass,", " might often be seen stretching its full lazy length on\nluxurious woollen rugs--the valued, pampered", " pets of \"West End\" life.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nA curious fact relating to the white cat of not only the ", "long but also\nthe short-haired breed is their deafness. Should they have blue eyes,\nwhich is the fan", "cy colour, these are nearly always deaf; although I have\nseen specimens whose hearing was as perfect", " as that of any other colour.\nStill deafness in white cats is not always confined to those with blue", "\neyes, as I too well know from purchasing a very fine male at the Crystal\nPalace Show some few years", " since. The price was low and the cat \"a\nbeauty,\" both in form, coat, and tail, his eyes were yellow", ", and he had\na nice, meek, mild, expressive face. I stopped and looked at him, as he\nmuch took my fa", "ncy. He stared at me wistfully, with something like\nmelancholy in the gaze of his _amber_-coloured e", "yes. I put my hand\nthrough the bars of the cage. He purred, licked my hand, rubbed against\nthe wires", ", put his tail up, as much as to say, \"See, here is a beautiful\ntail; am I not a lovely cat?\" \"Yes,\"", " thought I, \"a very nice cat.\" When\nI looked at my catalogue and saw the low price, \"something is wr", "ong\nhere,\" said I, musingly. \"Yes, there _must_ be something wrong. The\nprice is misstated, or there", " is something not right about this cat.\" No!\nit was a beauty--so comely, so loving, so gentle--so ve", "ry gentle.\n\"Well,\" said I to myself, \"if there is no misstatement of price, I will\nbuy this cat,\" an", "d, with a parting survey of its excellences, I went to\nthe office of the show manager. He looked at ", "the letter of entry. No;\nthe price was quite right--\"two guineas!\" \"I will buy it,\" said I. And\nso I", " did; but at two guineas I bought it dearly. Yes! very dearly, for\nwhen I got it home I found it was", " \"stone\" deaf. What an unhappy cat it\nwas! If shut out of the dining-room you could hear its cry for", " admission\nall over the house; being so deaf the poor wretched creature never knew\nthe noise it made", ". I often wish that it had so known--very, very often.\nI am satisfied that a tithe would have fright", "ened it out of its life.\nAnd so loving, so affectionate. But, oh! horror, when it called out as\nit s", "at on my lap, its voice seemed to acquire at least _ten cat power_.\nAnd when, if it lost sight of me", " in the garden, its voice rose to the\noccasion, I feel confident it might have been heard miles off.", " Alas! he\nnever knew what that agonised sound was like, but I did, and I have\nnever forgotten it, an", "d I never shall. I named him \"The Colonel\" on\naccount of his commanding voice.\n\nOne morning a friend", " came--blessed be that day--and after dinner he saw\n\"the beauty.\" \"What a lovely cat!\" said he. \"Yes", ",\" said I, \"he is very\nbeautiful, quite a picture.\" After a while he said, looking at \"Pussy\"\nwarmin", "g himself before the fire, \"I think I never saw one I liked more.\"\n\"Indeed,\" said I, \"if you really ", "think so, I will give it to you; but he\nhas a fault--he is 'stone' deaf.\" \"Oh, I don't mind that,\" s", "aid he. He\ntook him away--miles and miles away. I was glad it was so many miles\naway for two reasons", ". One was I feared he might come back, and the other\nthat his voice might come resounding on the sti", "ll night air. But he\nnever came back nor a sound.--A few days after he left \"to better\nhimself,\" a l", "etter came saying, would I wish to have him back? They\nliked it very much, all but its voice. \"No,\" ", "I wrote, \"no, you are very\nkind, no, thank you; give him to any one you please--do what you will\nwit", "h 'the beauty,' but it must not return, never.\" When next I saw my\nfriend, I asked him how \"the beau", "ty\" was. \"You dreadful man!\" said he;\n\"why, that cat nearly drove us all mad--I never heard anything", " like it.\"\n\"Nor I,\" said I, sententiously. \"Well,\" said my friend, \"'all is well\nthat ends well;' I ", "have given it to a very deaf old lady, and so both\nare happy.\" \"Very, I trust,\" said I.\n\nThe foregoi", "ng is by way of advice; in buying a white cat--or, in fact,\nany other--ascertain for a _certainty_ t", "hat it is _not deaf_.\n\n\n[Illustration]\n\nA short time since I saw a white Persian cat with deep blue ", "eyes sitting\nat the door of a tobacconist's, at the corner of the Haymarket, London.\nOn inquiry I fo", "und that the cat could hear perfectly, and was in no way\ndeficient of health and strength; and this ", "is by no means a solitary\ninstance.\n\n\n[Illustration: MISS SAUNDERS' \"TIGER.\"]\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nTH", "E ANGORA.\n\nThe Angora cat, as its name indicates, comes from Angora, in Western\nAsia, a province tha", "t is also celebrated for its goats with long hair,\nwhich is of extremely fine quality. It is said th", "at this deteriorates\nwhen the animal leaves that locality. This may be so, but that I have no\nmeans ", "of proving; yet, if so, do the Angora cats also deteriorate in the\nsilky qualities of their fur? Or ", "does it get shorter? Certain it is that\nmany of the imported cats have finer and longer hair than th", "ose bred in\nthis country; but when are the latter true bred? Even some a little\ncross-bred will ofte", "n have long hair, but not of the texture as regards\nlength and silkiness which is to be noted in the", " pure breed. The Angora\ncats, I am told, are great favourites with the Turks and Armenians, and\nthe ", "best are of high value, a pure white, with blue eyes, being thought\nthe perfection of cats, all othe", "r points being good, and its hearing by\nno means defective. The points are a small head, with not to", "o long a\nnose, large full eyes of a colour in harmony with that of its fur, ears\nrather large than s", "mall and pointed, with a tuft of hair at the apex,\nthe size not showing, as they are deeply set in t", "he long hair on the\nforehead, with a very full flowing mane about the head and neck; this\nlatter sho", "uld not be short, neither the body, which should be long,\ngraceful, and elegant, and covered with lo", "ng, silky hair, with a slight\nadmixture of woolliness; in this it differs from the Persian, and the\n", "longer the better. In texture it should be as fine as possible, and also\nnot so woolly as that of th", "e Russian; still it is more inclined to be so\nthan the Persian. The legs to be of moderate length, a", "nd in proportion\nto the body; the tail long, and slightly curving upward towards the end.\nThe hair s", "hould be very long at the base, less so toward the tip. When\nperfect, it is an extremely beautiful a", "nd elegant object, and no wonder\nthat it has become a pet among the Orientals. The colours are varie", "d;\nbut the black which should have orange eyes, as should also the slate\ncolours, and blues, and the", " white are the most esteemed, though the soft\nslates, blues, and the light fawns, deep reds, and mot", "tled grays are\nshades of colour that blend well with the Eastern furniture and other\nsurroundings. T", "here are also light grays, and what is termed smoke\ncolour; a beauty was shown at Brighton which was", " white with black tips\nto the hair, the white being scarcely visible, unless the hair was\nparted; th", "is tinting had a marvellous effect. I have never seen imported\nstrong-coloured tabbies of this breed", ", nor do I believe such are true\nAngoras. Fine specimens are even now rare in this country, and are\n", "extremely valuable. In manners and temper they are quiet, sociable, and\ndocile, though given to roam", "ing, especially in the country, where I have\nseen them far from their homes, hunting the hedgerows m", "ore like dogs\nthan cats; nor do they appear to possess the keen intelligence of the\nshort-haired Eur", "opean cat. They are not new to us, being mentioned by\nwriters nearly a hundred years ago, if not mor", "e. I well remember white\nspecimens of uncommon size on sale in Leadenhall Market, more than forty\nye", "ars since; the price usually was five guineas, though some of rare\nexcellence would realise double t", "hat sum.\n\n[Illustration: MISS MOORE'S \"DINAH.\"]\n\n\n\n[Illustration: MISS SAUNDERS' \"SYLVIE.\"]\n\n\n\n\nTHE ", "PERSIAN CAT.\n\n\nThis differs somewhat from the Angora, the tail being generally longer,\nmore like a t", "able brush in point of form, and is generally slightly\nturned upwards, the hair being more full and ", "coarser at the end, while\nat the base it is somewhat longer. The head is rather larger, with less\npo", "inted ears, although these should not be devoid of the tuft at the\napex, and also well furnished wit", "h long hair within, and of moderate\nsize. The eyes should be large, full, and round, with a soft exp", "ression;\nthe hair on the forehead is generally rather short in comparison to the\nother parts of the ", "body, which ought to be clothed with long silky hair,\nvery long about the neck, giving the appearanc", "e of the mane of the lion.\nThe legs, feet, and toes should be well clothed with long hair and have\nw", "ell-developed fringes on the toes, assuming the character of tufts\nbetween them. It is larger in bod", "y, and generally broader in the loins,\nand apparently stronger made, than the foregoing variety, tho", "ugh yet\nslender and elegant, with small bone, and exceedingly graceful in all\nits movements, there b", "eing a kind of languor observable in its walk,\nuntil roused, when it immediately assumes the quick m", "otion of the\nordinary short-haired cat, though not so alert. The colours vary very\nmuch, and compris", "e almost every tint obtainable in cats, though the\ntortoiseshell is not, nor is the dark marked tabb", "y, in my opinion, a\nPersian cat colour, but has been got by crossing with the short-haired\ntortoises", "hell, and also English tabby, and as generally shows pretty\nclearly unmistakable signs of such being", " the case. For a long time, if\nnot now, the black was the most sought after and the most difficult t", "o\nobtain. A good rich, deep black, with orange-coloured eyes and long\nflowing hair, grand in mane, l", "arge and with graceful carriage, with a\nmild expression, is truly a very beautiful object, and one v", "ery rare.\nThe best I have hitherto seen was one that belonged to Mr. Edward Lloyd,\nthe great authori", "ty on all matters relating to aquariums. It was called\nMimie, and was a very fine specimen, usually ", "carrying off the first\nprize wherever shown. It generally wore a handsome collar, on which was\ninscr", "ibed its name and victories. The collar, as Mr. Lloyd used jocosely\nto observe, really belonged to i", "t, as it was bought out of its winnings;\nand, according to the accounts kept, was proved also to hav", "e paid for\nits food for some considerable period. It was, as its owner laughingly\nsaid, \"his friend,", " and not his dependent,\" and generally used to sit on\nthe table by his side while he was writing eit", "her his letters, articles,\nor planning those improvements regarding aquariums, for which he was so\nj", "ustly celebrated.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nNext in value is the light slate or blue colour. This beautiful t", "int is\nvery different in its shades. In some it verges towards a light purplish\nor lilac hue, and is", " very lovely; in others it tends to a much bluer\ntone, having a colder and harder appearance, still ", "beautiful by way of\ncontrast; in all the colour should be pure, even, and bright, not in any\nway mot", "tled, which is a defect; and I may here remark that in these\ncolours the hair is generally of a soft", "er texture, as far as I have\nobserved, than that of any other colour, not excepting the white, which", "\nis also in much request. Then follow the various shades of light\ntabbies, so light in the marking h", "aving scarcely a right to be called\ntabbies; in fact, tabby is not a Persian colour, nor have I ever", " seen an\nimported cat of that colour--I mean firmly, strongly marked with black\non a brown-blue or g", "ray ground, until they culminate in those of intense\nrichness and density in the way of deep, harmon", "ious browns and reds, yet\nstill preserving throughout an extreme delicacy of line and tracery,\nnever", " becoming harsh or hard in any of its arrangements or colour; not\nas the ordinary short-haired tabby", ". The eyes should be orange-yellow in\nthe browns, reds, blues, grays, and blacks.\n\n[Illustration: MR", ". A. A. CLARKE'S \"TIM.\"]\n\nAs far as my experience extends, and I have had numerous opportunities\nof ", "noticing, I find this variety less reliable as regards temper than\nthe short-haired cats, less also ", "in the keen sense of observing, as in\nthe Angora, and also of turning such observations to account, ", "either as\nregards their comfort, their endeavour to help themselves, or in their\nefforts to escape f", "rom confinement.\n\nIn some few cases I have found them to be of almost a savage\ndisposition, biting a", "nd snapping more like a dog than a cat, and using\ntheir claws less for protective purposes. Nor have", " I found them so\n\"cossetty\" in their ways as those of the \"short-coats,\" though I have\nknown excepti", "ons in both.\n\nThey are much given to roam, as indeed are the Russian and Angora,\nespecially in the c", "ountry, going considerable distances either for their\nown pleasure or in search of food, or when \"on", " the hunt.\" After mature\nconsideration, I have come to the conclusion that this breed, and\nslightly ", "so the preceding, are decidedly different in their habits to\nthe short-haired English domestic cat, ", "as it is now generally called.\n\nIt may be, however, only a very close observer would notice the seve", "ral\npeculiarities which I consider certainly exist. These cats attach\nthemselves to places more than", " persons, and are indifferent to those who\nfeed and have the care of them. They are beautiful and us", "eful objects\nabout the house, and generally very pleasant companions, and when kept\nwith the short-h", "aired varieties form an exceedingly pretty and\ninteresting contrast; but, as I have stated, they cer", "tainly require more\nattention to their training, and more caution in their handling, than\nthe latter", ". I may here remark, that during the time I have acted as\njudge at cat shows, which is now over eigh", "teen years, it has been seldom\nthere has been any display of temper in the short-haired breeds in\nco", "mparison with the long; though some of the former, in some instances,\nhave not comported themselves ", "with that sweetness and amiability of\ndisposition that is their usual characteristic. My attendant h", "as been\nfrequently wounded in our endeavour to examine the fur, dentition, etc.,\nof the Angora, Pers", "ian, or Russian; and once severely by a \"short-hair.\"\nHitherto I have been so fortunate as to escape", " all injury, but this I\nattribute to my close observation of the _countenance_ and expression of\nthe", " cat about to be handled, so as to be perfectly on my guard, and to\nthe knowledge of how to put my h", "ands out of harm's way. If a vicious cat\nis to be taken from one pen to another, it must be carried ", "by the loose\nskin at the back of the neck and that of the back with both hands, and\nheld well away f", "rom the person who is carrying it.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nTHE RUSSIAN LONG-HAIRED CAT.", "\n\n\nThe above is a portrait of a cat given me many years ago, whose parents\ncame from Russia, but fro", "m what part I could never ascertain. It\ndiffered from the Angora and the Persian in many respects. I", "t was larger\nin the body with shorter legs. The mane or frill was very large, long,\nand dense, and m", "ore of a woolly texture, with coarse hairs among it; the\ncolour was of dark tabby, though the markin", "gs were not a decided black,\nnor clear and distinct; the ground colour was wanting in that depth and", "\nrichness possessed by the Persian, having a somewhat dull appearance.\nThe eyes were large and promi", "nent, of a bright orange, slightly tinted\nwith green, the ears large by comparison, with small tufts", ", full of\nlong, woolly hair, the limbs stout and short, the tail being very\ndissimilar, as it was sh", "ort, very woolly, and thickly covered with hair\nthe same length from the base to the tip, and much r", "esembled in form\nthat of the English wild cat. Its motion was not so agile as other cats,\nnor did it", " apparently care for warmth, as it liked being outdoors in the\ncoldest weather. Another peculiarity ", "being that it seemed to care little\nin the way of watching birds for the purpose of food, neither we", "re its\nhabits like those of the short-haired cats that were its companions. It\nattached itself to no", " person, as was the case with some of the others,\nbut curiously took a particular fancy to one of my", " short-haired,\nsilver-gray tabbies; the two appeared always together. In front of the\nfire they sat ", "side by side. If one left the room the other followed.\nAdown the garden paths there they were, still", " companions; and at night\nslept in the same box; they drank milk from the same saucer, and fed\nfrom ", "the same plate, and, in fact, only seemed to exist for each other.\nIn all my experience I never knew", " a more devoted couple. I bred but one\nkitten from the Russian, and this was the offspring of the sh", "ort-haired\nsilver tabby. It was black-and-white, and resembled the Russian in a\nlarge degree, having", " a woolly coat, somewhat of a mane, and a short,\nvery bushy tail.

Yet to the practised eye there is\ngenerally--I do not say always--a difference of some sort", " by which the\nparticular breed may be clearly defined. When the prizes are given, as\nis the case eve", "n at our largest cat shows, for the best long-haired cat,\nthere, of course, exists in the eye of the", " judge no distinction as\nregards breed. He selects, as he is bound to do, that which is the best\n_lo", "ng-haired_ cat in all points, the length of hair, colour, texture,\nand condition of the exhibit bein", "g that which commands his first\nattention. But if it were so put that the prize should be for the be", "st\nAngora, Persian, Russian, etc., it would make the task rather more than\ndifficult, for I have see", "n some \"first-cross cats\" that have possessed\nall, or nearly all, the points requisite for that of t", "he Angora,\nPersian, or Russian, while others so bred have been very deficient,\nperhaps showing the A", "ngora cross only by the tail and a slight and small\nfrill. At the same time it must be noted, that, ", "although from time to\ntime some excellent specimens may be so bred, it is by no means\ndesirable to b", "uy and use such for stock purposes, for they will in all\nprobability \"throw back\"--that is, after se", "veral generations, although\nallied with thoroughbred, they will possibly have a little family of\nqui", "te \"short-hairs.\" I have known this with rabbits, who, after breeding\nshort-haired varieties for som", "e time, suddenly reverted to a litter of\n\"long-hairs\"; but have not carried out the experiment with ", "cats. At the\nsame time I may state that I have little or no doubt that such would be\nthe case; there", "fore I would urge on all those who are fond of cats--or,\nin fact, other animals--of any particular b", "reed, to use when possible\nnone but those of the purest pedigree, as this will tend to prevent much\n", "disappointment that might otherwise ensue. But I am digressing, and so\nback to my subject--the Russi", "an long-haired cat. I advisedly say\nlong-haired cat, for I shall hereafter have to treat of other ca", "ts\ncoming from Russia that are short-haired, none which I have hitherto\nseen being tabbies, but whol", "e colour. This is the more singular as all\nthose of the long-hair have been brown tabbies, with only", " one or two\nexceptions, which were black. It is just possible these were the\noffspring of tabby or g", "ray parents, as the wild rabbit has been known to\nhave had black progeny. I have seen a black rabbit", " shot from amongst the\ngray on the South Downs.\n\n[Illustration: MISS MARY GRESHAM'S PERSIAN KITTEN, ", "\"LAMBKIN.\"]\n\nI do not remember having seen a white Russian \"long-hair,\" and I should\nfeel particular", "ly obliged to any of my readers who could supply me with\nfurther information on this subject, or on ", "any other relating to the\nvarious breeds of cats, cat-life and habits.

They are an exceedingly\ninteresting secti", "on; their habits, manners, forms, and colours form a by\nno means unprofitable study for those fond o", "f animal life, as they, in\nmy opinion, differ in many ways from those of their \"short-haired\"\nbrethr", "en. I shall not cease, however, in my endeavours to find out if\nany other long-haired breeds exist, ", "and I am, therefore, making\ninquiries in every direction in which I deem it likely I shall get an\nin", "crease of information on the subject, but hitherto without any\nsuccess. Therefore, I am led to suppo", "se that the three I have\nenumerated are the only domesticated long-haired varieties. The nearest\napp", "roach, I believe, to these in the wild state is that of the British\nwild cat, which has in some inst", "ances a mane and a bushy tail, slightly\nresembling that of the Russian long-hair, with much of the s", "ame facial\nexpression, and rather pointed tufts at the apex of the ears. It is also\nlarge, like some", " of the \"long-haired\" cats that I have seen; in fact, it\nfar more resembles these breeds than those ", "of the short hair. I was much\nstruck with the many points of similitude on seeing the British wild c", "at\nexhibited by the Duke of Sutherland at the first cat show at the Crystal\nPalace in July, 1871. I ", "merely offer this as an idea for further\nconsideration. At the same time, allow me to say that I hav", "e had no\nopportunity of studying the anatomy of the British wild cat, in\ncontradistinction to that o", "f the Russian, or others with long hair. I\nonly wish to point out what I term a general resemblance,", " far in excess\nof those with short hair. I am fully aware how difficult it is to trace\nany origin of", " the domestic cat, or from what breeds; it is also said,\nthat the British wild cat is not one of the", "m, still I urge there exists\nthe similarity I mention; whether it is so apparent to others I know\nno", "t.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n[Illustration: MR. SMITH'S PRIZE HE-CAT.]\n\n\n\n\nTHE TORTOISESHELL CAT.\n\n\nI now co", "me to the section of the short-haired domestic cat, a variety\npossessing sub-varieties. Whether thes", "e all came from the same origin is\ndoubtful, although in breeding many of the different colours will", " breed\nback to the striped or tabby colour, and, _per contra_, white\nwhole-coloured cats are often g", "ot from striped or spotted parents, and\n_vice vers\u00e2_. Those that have had any experience of breeding", "\ndomesticated animals or birds, know perfectly well how difficult it is\nto keep certain peculiaritie", "s gained by years of perseverance of\nbreeding for such points of variation, or what is termed excell", "ence.\nPlace a few fancy pigeons, for instance, in the country and let them\nmatch how they like, and ", "one would be quite surprised, unless he were a\nnaturalist, to note the great changes that occur in a", " few years, and the\nunmistakable signs of reversion towards their ancestral stock--that of\nthe Rock ", "pigeon. But with the cat this is somewhat different, as little\nor no attempts have been made, as far", " as I know of, until cat shows were\ninstituted, to improve any particular breed either in form or co", "lour.\nNor has it even yet, with the exception of the long-haired cats. Why\nthis is so I am at a loss", " to understand, but the fact remains. Good\nwell-developed cats of certain colours fetch large prices", ", and are, if I\nmay use the term, perpetual prize-winners. I will take as an instance\nthe tortoisesh", "ell tom, he, or male cat as one of the most scarce, and\nthe red or yellow tabby she-cat as the next;", " and yet the possessor of\neither, with proper care and attention, I have little or no doubt, has\nit ", "in his power to produce either variety _ad libitum_. It is now many\nyears since I remember the first", " \"tortoiseshell tom-cat;\" nor can I now\nat this distance of time quite call to mind whether or not i", "t was not a\ntortoiseshell-and-white, and not a tortoiseshell pure and simple. It was\nexhibited in Pi", "ccadilly. If I remember rightly, I made a drawing of it,\nbut as it is about forty years ago, of this", " I am not certain, although I\nhave lately been told that I did, and that the price asked for the cat", "\nwas 100 guineas.\n\n[Illustration: EXAMPLE OF TORTOISESHELL CAT, VERY DARK VARIETY.]\n\nThis supposed s", "carcity was rudely put aside by the appearance, at the\nCrystal Palace Show of 1871, of no less than ", "one tortoiseshell he-cat\n(exhibited by Mr. Smith) and three tortoiseshell-and-white he-cats, but\nit ", "will be observed there was really but only one tortoiseshell he-cat,\nthe others having white. On ref", "erring to the catalogues of the\nsucceeding shows, no other pure tortoiseshell has been exhibited, an", "d he\nceased to appear after 1873; but tortoiseshell-and-white have been shown\nfrom 1871, varying in ", "number from five to three until 1885. One of\nthese, a tortoiseshell-and-white belonging to Mr. Hurry", ", gained no fewer\nthan nine first prizes at the Crystal Palace, besides several firsts at\nother show", "s; this maintains my statement, that a really good scarce\nvariety of cats is a valuable investment, ", "Mr. Hurry's cat Totty keeping\nup his price of \u00a3100 till the end.\n\nAs may have been gathered from the", " foregoing remarks, the points of the\ntortoiseshell he-cat are, black-red and yellow in patches, but", " no\n_white_. The colouring should be in broad, well-defined blotches and\nsolid in colour, not mealy ", "or tabby-like in the marking, but clear,\nsharp, and distinct, and the richer and deeper the colours ", "the better.\nWhen this is so the animal presents a very handsome appearance. The eyes\nshould be orang", "e, the tail long and thick towards the base, the form\nslim, graceful, and elegant, and not too short", " on the leg, to which this\nbreed has a tendency. Coming then to the actual tortoiseshell he, or\nmale", " cat without white, I have never seen but one at the Shows, and that\nwas exhibited by Mr. Smith. It ", "does not appear that Mr. Smith bred any\nfrom it, nor do I know whether he took any precautions to do", " so; but if\nnot, I am still of the opinion that more might have been produced. In\nCassell's \"Natural", " History,\" it is stated that the tortoiseshell cat is\nquite common in Egypt and in the south of Euro", "pe. This I can readily\nbelieve, as I think that it comes from a different stock than the usual\nshort", "-haired cat, the texture of the hair being different, the form of\ntail also. I should much like to k", "now whether in that country, where the\nvariety is so common, there exists any number of tortoiseshel", "l he-cats.\nIn England the he-kittens are almost invariably red-tabby or\nred-tabby-and-white; the red", "-tabby she-cats are almost as scarce as\ntortoiseshell-and-white he-cats. Yet if red-tabby she-cats c", "an be\nproduced, I am of opinion that tortoiseshell he-cats could also. I had\none of the former, a gr", "eat beauty, and hoped to perpetuate the breed,\nbut it unfortunately fell a victim to wires set by po", "achers for game.\nAgain returning to the tortoiseshell, I have noted that, in drawings\nmade by the Ja", "panese, the cats are always of this colour; that being so,\nit leads one to suppose that in that coun", "try tortoiseshell he-cats must\nbe plentiful. Though the drawings are strong evidence, they are not\na", "bsolute proof. I have asked several travelling friends questions as\nregards the Japanese cats, but i", "n no case have I found them to have\ntaken sufficient notice for their testimony to be anything else ", "than\nworthless. I shall be very thankful for any information on this subject,\nfor to myself, and dou", "btless also to many others, it is exceedingly\ninteresting. Any one wishing to breed rich brown tabbi", "es, should use a\ntortoiseshell she-cat with a very brown and black-banded he-cat. They\nare not so go", "od from the spotted tabby, often producing merely\ntortoiseshell tabbies instead of brown tabbies, or", " true tortoiseshells.\nMy remarks as to the colouring of the tortoiseshell he-cat are equally\napplica", "ble to the she-cat, which should not have any white. Of the\ntortoiseshell-and-white hereafter.\n\nTo b", "reed tortoiseshell he-cats, I should use males of a whole colour,\nsuch as either white, black, or bl", "ue; and on no account any tabby, no\nmatter the colour. What is wanted is patches of colour, not tiny", " streaks\nor spots; and I feel certain that, for those who persevere, there will\nbe successful result", "s.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nTHE TORTOISESHELL-AND-WHITE CAT.\n\n\nThis is a more common mix", "ture of colouring than the tortoiseshell pure\nand simple without white, and seems to be widely sprea", "d over different\nparts of the world. It is the opinion of some that this colour and the\npure tortois", "eshell is the original domestic cat, and that the other\nvarieties of marking and colours are but dev", "iations produced by\ncrossing with wild varieties. My brother, John Jenner Weir, F.L.S.,\nF.Z.S., hold", "s somewhat to this opinion; but, to me, it is rather\ndifficult to arrive at this conclusion. In fact", ", I can scarcely\nrealise the ground on which the theory is based--at the same time, I\ndo not mean to", " ignore it entirely. And yet, if this be so, from what\nstarting-point was the original domestic cat ", "derived, and by what\nmeans were the rich and varied markings obtained? I am fully aware\nthat by sele", "ction cats with large patches of colour may be obtained;\nstill, there remain the peculiar markings o", "f the tortoiseshell. Nor is\nthis by any means an uncommon colour, not only in this country, but in\nm", "any others, and there also appears to be a peculiar fixedness of\nthis, especially in the female, but", " why it is not so in the male I am\nat a loss to understand, the males almost invariably coming eithe", "r\nred-tabby or red-tabby-and-white. One would suppose that black or\nwhite would be equally likely; b", "ut, as far as my observations take me,\nthis is not so, though I have seen both pure white, yellow, r", "ed, and\nblack in litters of kittens, but this might be different were the he\nparent tortoiseshell.\n\n", "Some years ago I was out with a shooting party not far from\nSnowdon, in Wales, when turning past a l", "arge rock I came on a\nsheltered nook, and there in a nest made of dry grasses laid six\ntortoiseshell", "-and-white kittens about eight to ten days old. I was\nmuch surprised at this, as I did not know of a", "ny house near,\ntherefore these must have been the offspring of some cat or cats\nthat were leading a ", "roving or wild life, and yet it had no effect\nas to the deviation of the colour. I left them there, ", "and without\nobserving the sex. I was afterwards sorry, as it is just possible,\nthough scarcely proba", "ble, that one or more of the six, being all\nof the same colour, might have proved to be a male. As I", " left the\nneighbourhood a few days after I saw no more of them, nor have I\nsince heard of any being ", "there; so conclude they in some way were\ndestroyed.\n\nI have observed in the breed of tortoiseshell o", "r\ntortoise-shell-and-white that the hair is of a coarser texture than\nthe ordinary domestic cat, and", " that the tail is generally thicker,\nespecially at the base, though some few are thin-tailed; yet I ", "prefer\nthe thick and tapering form. Some are very much so, and of a good\nlength; the legs are genera", "lly somewhat short; I do not ever remember\nseeing a really long-legged tortoiseshell, though when th", "is is so if\nnot too long it adds much to its grace of action. I give a drawing of\nwhat I consider to", " be a GOOD tortoiseshell-and-white tom or he-cat. It\nwill be observed that there is more white on th", "e chest, belly, and\nhind legs than is allowable in the black-and-white cat. This I deem\nnecessary fo", "r artistic beauty, when the colour is laid on in\n_patches_, although it should be even, clear, and d", "istinct in its\noutline; the larger space of white adds brilliancy to the red, yellow,\nand black colo", "uring. The face is one of the parts which should have\nsome uniformity of colour, and yet not so, but", " a mere _balancing_ of\ncolour; that is to say, that there should be a _relief_ in black, with\nthe ye", "llow and red on each side, and so in the body and tail. The nose\nshould be white, the eyes orange, a", "nd the whole colouring rich and\nvaried without the least _Tabbyness_, either brown or gray or an\napp", "roach to it, such being highly detrimental to its beauty.\n\nI have received a welcome letter from Mr.", " Herbert Young, of James\nStreet, Harrogate, informing me of the existence of what is said to be\na to", "rtoiseshell tom or he-cat somewhere in Yorkshire, and the price is\nfifty guineas; but he, unfortunat", "ely, has forgotten the exact address.\nHe also kindly favours me with the further information of a\nto", "rtoiseshell-and-white he-cat. He describes it as \"splendid,\" and\n\"extra good in colour,\" and it is a", "t present in the vicinity of\nHarrogate. And still further, Mr. Herbert Young says, \"I am breeding\nfr", "om a dark colour cat and two tortoiseshell females,\" and he hopes,\nby careful selection, to succeed ", "in \"breeding the other colour out.\"\nThis, I deem, is by no means an unlikely thing to happen, and, b", "y\ncareful management, may not take very long to accomplish; but much\ndepends on the ancestry, or rat", "her the pedigree of both sides. I for\none most heartily wish Mr. Herbert Young success, and it will ", "be most\ngratifying should he arrive at the height of his expectations. Failing\nthe producing of the ", "desired colour in the he-cats by the legitimate\nmethod of tortoiseshell with tortoiseshell, I would ", "advise the trial\nof some _whole_ colours, such as solid black and white. This _may_\nprove a better w", "ay than the other, as we pigeon fanciers go an\napparently roundabout way often to obtain what we wan", "t to attain in\ncolour, and yet there is almost a certainty in the method.\n\nAs regards the tortoisesh", "ell cat, there is a distinct variety known to\nus cat fanciers as the tortoiseshell-tabby. This must ", "not be\nconfounded with the true variety, as it consists only of a variegation\nin colour of the yello", "w, the red, and the dark tabby, and is more in\nlines than patches, or patches of lines or spots. The", "se are by no\nmeans ugly, and a well-marked, richly-coloured specimen is really very\nhandsome. They m", "ay also be intermixed with white, and should be marked\nthe same as the true tortoiseshell; but in co", "mpetition with the _real_\ntortoiseshell they would stand _no chance_ whatever, and ought in my\nopini", "on to be disqualified as being wrong class, and be put in that\nfor \"any other colour.\"\n\n[Illustratio", "n: MRS.

This stuff, in bygone times, was often called\n\"tabby:\" hence the cat with lines or ma", "rkings on its fur was called a\n\"tabby\" cat. But it might also, one would suppose, with as much justi", "ce,\nbe called a taffety cat, unless the calendering of \"taffety\" caused it\nto become \"tabby.\" Certai", "n it is that the word tabby only referred to\nthe marking or stripes, not to the absolute colour, for", " in \"Wit and\nDrollery\" (1682), p. 343, is the following:--\n\n    \"Her petticoat of satin,\n    Her gow", "n of crimson tabby.\"\n\nBe that as it may, I think there is little doubt that the foregoing was\nthe or", "igin of the term.

These should be marked with _spots_\ninstead of _bands_, on the same ground colour as the re", "d or\nyellow-banded tabby cat. In the former the ground colour should be a\nrich red, with spots of a ", "deep, almost chocolate colour, while that of\nthe yellow tabby may be a deep yellow cream, with yello", "wish-brown spots.\nBoth are very scarce, and are extremely pretty. Any admixture of white\nis not allo", "wable in the class for yellow or red tabbies; such exhibit\nmust be put into the class (should there ", "be one, which is usually the\ncase at large shows) for red or yellow and _white_ tabbies. This\nexhibi", "tors will do well to make a note of.\n\nThere is a rich-coloured brown tabby hybrid to be seen at the ", "Zoological\nSociety Gardens in Regent's Park, between the wild cat of Bengal and a\ntabby she-cat. It ", "is handsome, but very wild. These hybrids, I am told,\nwill breed again with tame variety, or with ot", "hers.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nIn the brown-spotted tabby, the dark gray-spotted tabby, the\nblack-spotted ta", "bby, the gray or the blue-spotted tabby, the eyes are\nbest yellow or orange tinted, with the less of", " the green the better. The\nnose should be of a dark red, edged with black or dark brown, in the\ndark", " colours, or somewhat lighter colour in the gray or blue tabbies.\nThe pads of the feet in all instan", "ces must be black. In the yellow and\nthe red tabby the nose and the pads of the feet are to be pink.", " As\nregards the tail, that should have large spots on the upper and lower\nsides instead of being ann", "ulated, but this is difficult to obtain. It\nhas always occurred to me that the spotted tabby is a mu", "ch nearer\napproach to the wild English cat and some other wild cats in the way of\ncolour than the or", "dinary broad-banded tabby. Those specimens of the\ncrosses, said to be between the wild and domestic ", "cat, that I have seen,\nhave had a tendency to be spotted tabbies. And these crosses were not\ninfrequ", "ent in bygone times when the wild cats were more numerous than\nat present, as is stated to be the ca", "se by that reliable authority,\nThomas Bewick. In the year 1873, there was a specimen shown at the\nCr", "ystal Palace Cat Show, and also the last year or two there has been\nexhibited at the same place a mo", "st beautiful hybrid between the East\nIndian wild cat and the domestic cat. It was shown in the spott", "ed tabby\nclass, and won the first prize. The ground colour was a deep\nblackish-brown, with well-defi", "ned black spots, black pads to the feet,\nrich in colour, and very strong and powerfully made, and no", "t by any\nmeans a sweet temper. It was a he-cat, and though I have made inquiry, I\nhave not been able", " to ascertain that any progeny has been reared from\nit, yet I have been informed that such hybrids b", "etween the Indian wild\ncat and the domestic cat breed freely.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nTHE ABYSSINIAN.\n\n\n", "I now come to the last variety of the tabby cat, and this can scarcely\nbe called a tabby proper, as ", "it is nearly destitute of markings,\nexcepting sometimes on the legs and a broad black band along the", " back.\nIt is mostly of a deep brown, ticked with black, somewhat resembling the\nback of a wild (only", " not so gray) rabbit. Along the centre of the back,\nfrom the nape of the neck to the tip of the tail", ", there is a band of\nblack, very slightly interspersed with dark brown hairs. The inner sides\nof the", " legs and belly are more of a rufous-orange tint than the body,\nand are marked in some cases with a ", "few dark patches; but they are best\nwithout these marks, and in the exhibition pens it is a point lo", "st. The\neyes are deep yellow, tinted with green; nose dark red, black-edged;\nears rather small, dark", " brown, with black edges and tips; the pads of\nthe feet are black. Altogether, it is a pretty and in", "teresting variety.\nIt has been shown under a variety of names, such as Russian, Spanish,\nAbyssinian,", " Hare cat, Rabbit cat, and some have gone so far as to\nmaintain that it is a cross between the latte", "r and a cat, proving very\nunmistakably there is nothing, however absurd or impossible, in animal\nor ", "everyday life, that some people are not ready to credit and believe.\nA hybrid between the English wi", "ld cat and the domestic much resembles\nit; and I do not consider it different in any way, with the e", "xception of\nits colour, from the ordinary tabby cat, from which I have seen kittens\nand adults beari", "ng almost the same appearance. Some years ago when out\nrabbit-shooting on the South Downs, not far f", "rom Eastbourne, one of our\nparty shot a cat of this colour in a copse not far from the village of\nEa", "stdean. He mistook it at first for a rabbit as it dashed into the\nunderwood. It proved not to be wil", "d, but belonged to one of the\nvillagers, and was bred in the village. When the ground colour is ligh", "t\ngray or blue, it is generally called chinchilla, to the fur of which\nanimal the coat has a general", " resemblance. I have but little inclination\nto place it as a distinct, though often it is of foreign", " breed; such may\nbe, though ours is merely a variety--and a very interesting one--of the\nordinary ta", "bby, with which its form, habits, temper, etc., seem fully to\ncorrespond; still several have been im", "ported from Abyssinia all of which\nwere precisely similar, and it is stated that this is the origin ", "of the\nEgyptian cat that was worshipped so many centuries ago. The mummies of\nthe cats I have seen i", "n no case had any hair left, so that it was\nimpossible to determine what colour they were. The impor", "ted cats are of\nstouter build than the English and less marked. These bred with an\nEnglish tabby oft", "en give a result of nearly black, the back band\nextending very much down the sides, and the brown ti", "cks almost\ndisappearing, producing a rich and beautiful colouring.\n\nI find there is yet another tint", " or colour of the tabby proper which I\nhave not mentioned, that is to say, a cat marked with light w", "avy lines,\nand an exceedingly pretty one it is. It is very rare; in fact, so much\nso that it has nev", "er had a class appropriated to it, and therefore is\nonly admissible to or likely to win in the class", " \"For Any Other Colour,\"\nin which class usually a number of very beautiful varieties are to be\nfound", ", some of which I shall have occasion to notice further on. The\ncolour, however, that I now refer to", " is often called the silver tabby,\nfor want of a better name. It is this. The whole of the ground co", "lour is\nof a most delicate silver-gray, clear and firm in tone, slightly blue if\nanything apart from", " the gray, and the markings thereon are but a little\ndarker, with a tinge of lilac in them making th", "e fur to look like an\nevening sky, rayed with light clouds. The eyes are orange-yellow, and\nwhen lar", "ge and full make a fine contrast to the colour of the fur. The\nnose is red, edged with a lilac tint,", " and the pads of the feet and\nclaws are black, or nearly so. The hair is generally very fine, short,", "\nand soft. Altogether it is most lovely, and well worthy of attention,\nforming, as it does, a beauti", "ful contrast to the red, the yellow, or\neven the brown tabby. A turquoise ribbon about its neck will", " show to\ngreat advantage the delicate lilac tints of its coat, or, if a contrast\nis preferred, a lig", "ht orange scarlet, or what is often called geranium\ncolour, will perhaps give a brighter and more pl", "easing effect.\n\n[Illustration: MRS. HERRING'S BLUE SMALL-BANDED TABBY.]\n\nThis is by no means so unco", "mmon a colour in the _long-haired_ cats,\nsome of which are exquisite, and are certainly the acme of ", "beauty in the\nway of cat colouring; but I must here remark that there is a vast\ndifference in the wa", "y of disposition between these two light varieties,\nthat of the former being far more gentle. In fac", "t, I am of opinion that\nthe short-haired cat in general is of a more genial temperament, more\n\"cosse", "tty,\" more observant, more quick in adapting itself to its\nsurroundings and circumstances than its l", "ong-haired brother, and, as a\nrule, it is also more cleanly in its habits. Though at the same time I", "\nam willing to admit that some of these peculiarities being set aside,\nthe long-haired cat is charmi", "ngly beautiful, and at the same time has a\nlarge degree of intelligence--in fact, much more than mos", "t animals that\nI know, not even setting aside the dog, and I have come to this\nconclusion after much", " long, careful, and mature consideration.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nTHE SHORT-HAIRED WHIT", "E CAT.\n\n\nThis of all, as it depends entirely on its comeliness, should be\ngraceful and elegant in th", "e outline of its form and also action, the\nhead small, not too round nor thick, for this gives a clu", "msy, heavy\nappearance, but broad on the forehead, and gently tapering towards the\nmuzzle, the nose s", "mall, tip even and pink, the ears rather small than\nlarge, and not too pointed, the neck slender, sh", "oulders narrow and\nsloping backwards, loin full and long, legs of moderate length, tail\nwell set on,", " long, broad at the base, and gradually tapering towards the\nend; the white should be the yellow-whi", "te, that is, the white of the\ncolours, such as tortoiseshell, red tabby or blues, not the gray-white", "\nbred from the black, as these are coarser in the quality of the furs.\nThe eye should be large, roun", "d, full, and blue. I noted this peculiarity\nof white when breeding white Cochins many years ago; tho", "se chickens that\nwere black when hatched were a colder and harder white than those which\nwere hatche", "d buff. This colouring of white should be fully borne in mind\nwhen crossing colours in breeding, as ", "the results are widely different\nfrom the two varieties. The whole colour yellow-white will not do t", "o\nmatch with blue or gray, as it will assuredly give the wrong tinge or\ncolour.\n\nThe eyes should be ", "blue; green is a great defect; bright yellow is\nallowable, or what in horses is called \"wall eyes.\" ", "Orange gives a heavy\nappearance; but yellow will harmonise and look well with a gray-white.\n\nWhite c", "ats with blue eyes are hardy. Mr. Timbs, in \"Things Not Generally\nKnown,\" relates that even they are", " not so likely to be deaf as is\nsupposed, and mentions one of seventeen years old which retained its", "\nhearing faculties perfectly. Some specimens I have seen with one yellow\neye and one blue; this is a", " most singular freak of nature, and to the\nbest of my knowledge is not to be found among any of the ", "other colours.\n\nIt is stated that one of the white horses recently presented by the Shah\nof Persia t", "o the Emperor of Russia has blue eyes. I can scarcely credit\nthis, but think it must be a true albin", "o, with the gray-pink coloured\neyes they generally have, or possibly the blue eye is that peculiar t", "o\nthe _albino_ cat and horse, as I have never seen an albino horse or cat\nwith pink eyes but a kind ", "of opalesque colour, or what is termed \"wall\neye.\" No doubt many of my readers have observed the dif", "ferences in the\nwhite of our horses, they mostly being the gray-white, with dark skin;\nbut the purer", " white has a pink skin, and is much softer and elegant in\nappearance. It is the same with our white ", "cats.\n\n\n\n\nTHE BLACK CAT.\n\n\nIt is often said \"What's in a name?\" the object, whatever it is, by any\no", "ther would be the same, and yet there is much in a name; but this is\nnot the question at issue, whic", "h is that of colour. Why should a _black_\ncat be thought so widely different from all others by the ", "foolish,\nunthinking, and ignorant? Why, simply on account of its colour being\nblack, should it have ", "ascribed to it a numberless variety of bad omens,\nbesides having certain necromantic power? In Germa", "ny, for instance,\nblack cats are kept away from children as omens of evil, and if a black\ncat appear", "ed in the room of one lying ill it was said to portend death.\nTo meet a black cat in the twilight wa", "s held unlucky. In the \"good old\ntimes\" a black cat was generally the only colour that was favoured ", "by\nmen reported to be wizards, and also were said to be the constant\ncompanions of reputed witches, ", "and in such horror and detestation were\nthey then held that when the unfortunate creatures were ill-", "treated,\ndrowned, or even burned, very frequently we are told that their cats\nsuffered martyrdom at ", "the same time. It is possible that one of the\nreasons for such wild, savage superstition may have ar", "isen from the fact\nof the larger amount of electricity to be found by friction in the coat\nof the bl", "ack cat to any other; experiments prove there is but very\nlittle either in that of the white or the ", "red tabby cat. Be this as it\nmay, still the fact remains that, for some reason or other, the black\nc", "at is held by the prejudiced ignorant as an animal most foul and\ndetestable, and wonderful stories a", "re related of their actions in the\ndead of the night during thunder-storms and windy nights. Yet, as", " far as\nI can discover, there appears little difference either of temper or\nhabit in the black cat d", "istinct from that of any other colour, though it\nis maintained by many even to this day that black c", "ats are far more\nvicious and spiteful and of higher courage, and this last I admit.\nStill, when a bl", "ack cat is enraged and its coat and tail are well \"set\nup,\" its form swollen, its round, bright, ora", "nge-yellow eye distended\nand all aglow with anger, it certainly presents to even the most\nimpartial ", "observer, to say the least of it, a most \"uncanny\" appearance.\nBut, for all this, their admirers are", " by no means few; and, to my\nthinking, a jet-black cat, fine and glossy in fur and elegantly formed,", "\ncertainly has its attractions; but I will refer to the superstitions\nconnected with the black cat f", "urther on.\n\nA black cat for show purposes should be of a uniform, intense black; a\nbrown-black is ri", "cher than a blue-black. I mean by this that when the\nhair is parted it should show in the division a", " dark brown-black in\npreference to any tint of blue whatever. The coat or fur should be\nshort, velve", "ty, and very glossy. The eyes round and full, and of a deep\norange colour; nose black, and also the ", "pads of the feet; tail long,\nwide at the base, and tapering gradually towards the end. A long thin\nt", "ail is a great fault, and detracts much from the merits it may\notherwise possess. A good, deep, rich", "-coloured black cat is not so\ncommon as many may at first suppose, as often those that are said to b", "e\nblack show tabby markings under certain conditions of light; and, again,\nothers want depth and ric", "hness of colour, some being only a very dark\ngray. In form it is the same as other short-haired cats", ", such as I have\ndescribed in the white, and this brings me to the variety called\n\"blue.\"\n\n[Illustra", "tion: ARCHANGEL BLUE CAT.]\n\n\n\n\nTHE BLUE CAT.\n\n\nThis is shown often under a number of names. It was a", "t first shown as\nthe Archangel cat, then Russian blue, Spanish blue, Chartreuse blue,\nand, lastly, a", "nd I know not why, the American blue. It is not, in my\nbelief, a distinct breed, but merely a light-", "coloured form of the black\ncat. In fact, I have ascertained that one shown at the Crystal Palace,\nan", "d which won many prizes on account of its beautiful blue colour\nslightly tinged with purple, was the", " offspring of a tabby and white\nshe-cat and a black-and-white he-cat, and I have seen the same colou", "r\noccur when bred from the cats usually kept about a farmhouse as a\nprotection from rats and mice, t", "hough none of the parents had any blue\ncolour.\n\nBeing so beautiful, and as it is possible in some pl", "aces abroad it may\nbe bred in numbers, I deemed it advisable, when making out the prize\nschedule, to", " give special prizes for this colour; the fur being used for\nvarious purposes on account of its hue.", " A fine specimen should be even\nin colour, of a bluish-lilac tint, with no sootiness or black, and\nt", "hough light be firm and rich in tone, the nose and pads dark, and the\neyes orange-yellow. If of a ve", "ry light blue-gray, the nose and pads may\nbe of a deep chocolate colour and the eyes deep yellow, no", "t green. If it\nis a foreign variety, I can only say that I see no distinction in form,\ntemper, or ha", "bit; and, as I have before mentioned, it is sometimes bred\nhere in England from cats bearing no rese", "mblance to the bluish-lilac\ncolour, nor of foreign extraction or pedigree. I feel bound, however, to", "\nadmit that those that came from Archangel were of a deeper, purer tint\nthan the English cross-breed", "s; and on reference to my notes, I find they\nhad larger ears and eyes, and were larger and longer in", " the head and\nlegs, also the coat or fur was excessively short, rather inclined to\nwoolliness, but b", "right and glossy, the hair inside the ears being\nshorter than is usual in the English cat.\n\n[Illustr", "ation]\n\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nTHE BLACK-AND-WHITE CAT.\n\n\nThis is distinct from the _white-and-black_ c", "at, the ground colour being\nblack, marked with white; while the other is white, marked with black.\nT", "he chief points of excellence for show purposes are a dense bright\nbrown-black, evenly marked with w", "hite. Of this I give an illustration,\nshowing the most approved way in which the white should be dis", "tributed,\ncoming to a point between the eyes. The feet should be white, and the\nchest, the nose, and", " the pads white. No black on the lips or nose,\nwhiskers white, eyes of orange yellow.

One great\npoint ", "is to obtain a perfectly clear and distinct gracefully-curved\noutline of colour, and this to be main", "tained throughout; the blaze on\nthe forehead to be central. It is stated that if a dog has white\nany", "where, he is sure to have a white tip to his tail, and I think, on\nobservation, it will be found usu", "ally the case, although this is not so\nin the cat, for I cannot call to mind a single instance where", " a\nblack-and-white had a white tip to its tail; but taking the various\ncolours of the domestic cat i", "nto consideration I think it will be found\nthat there is a larger number with some white about them ", "than those of\nentirely one colour, without even a few white hairs, which if they\nappear at all are m", "ostly to be found on the chest, though they often are\nexceedingly few in number.\n\n[Illustration: MRS", ". VYVYAN'S ROYAL CAT OF SIAM.]\n\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\nTHE WHITE-AND-BLACK CAT.\n\n\nThis differs entirely ", "from the black-and-white cat, as just explained,\nand is the opposite as regards colour, the ground b", "eing white instead of\nblack, and the markings black on white. For exhibition purposes and\npoints of ", "excellence, no particular rule exists beyond that the exhibit\nshall be evenly marked, with the colou", "r distributed so as to balance,\nas, for example:--If a cat has a black patch just _under_ one eye wi", "th a\n_little above_, the balance of colour would be maintained if the other\neye had a preponderance ", "of colour _above_ instead of _below_, and so\nwith the nose, shoulders, or back, but it would be far ", "better if the\npatches of colour were the same size and shape, and equal in position.\nIt might be tha", "t a cat evenly marked on the head had a mark on the left\nshoulder with more on the right, with a rat", "her larger patch on the right\nside of the loin, or a black tail would help considerably to produce\nw", "hat is termed \"_balance_,\" though a cat of this description would lose\nif competing against one of e", "ntirely uniform markings.\n\nI have seen several that have been marked in a very singular way. One\nwas", " entirely white, with black ears. Another white, with a black tail\nonly. This had orange eyes, and w", "as very pretty. Another had a black\nblaze up the nose, the rest of the animal being white. This had ", "blue\neyes, and was deaf.

All these, it will be\nobserved, were perfect in the way they were marked.\n\nI giv", "e an illustration of a cat belonging to Mr. S. Lyon, of Crewe. It\nis remarkable in more ways than on", "e, and in all probability, had it been\nborn in \"the dark ages\" a vast degree of importance would hav", "e been\nattached to it, not only on account of the peculiar distribution of the\ncolour and its form, ", "but also as to the singular coincidence of its\nbirth. The head is white, with a black mark over the ", "eyes and ears\nwhich, when looked at from above, presents the appearance of a\n_fleur-de-lis_. The bod", "y is white, with a distinct black cross on the\nright side, or, rather, more on the back than side. T", "he cross resembles\nthat known as Maltese in form, and is clearly defined. The tail is\nblack, the leg", "s and feet white. Nor does the cat's claim to notice\nentirely end here, for, marvellous to relate, i", "t was born on Easter\nSunday, A.D. 1886. Now, what would have been said of such a coincidence\nhad thi", "s peculiar development of Nature occurred in bygone times? There\nis just the possibility that the cr", "edulous would have \"flocked\" to see\nthe wondrous animal from far and near; and even now, in these\nen", "lightened times, I learn from Mr. Lyon that the cat is not by any\nmeans devoid of interest and attra", "ction, for, as he tells me, a number\nof persons have been to see it, some of whom predict that \"luck", "\" will\nfollow, and that he and his household will, in consequence, _doubtless_\nenjoy many blessings,", " and that all things will prosper with him\naccordingly.\n\nAlthough my remarks are directed to \"the wh", "ite-and-black\" cat, the same\nwill apply to the \"white-and-red, white-and-yellow, white-and-tabby,\nwh", "ite-and-blue, or dun colour;\" all these, and the foregoing, will most\nprobably have to be exhibited ", "in the \"Any Other Colour\" class, as there\nis seldom one at even the largest shows for peculiar marki", "ngs with white\nas the _ground_ or principal colour.\n\n[Illustration: WHITE CAT.]\n\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n", "\nSIAMESE CAT.\n\n\nAmong the beautiful varieties of the domestic cat brought into notice by\nthe cat sho", "ws, none deserve more attention than \"The Royal Cat of Siam.\"\nIn form, colour, texture, and length, ", "or rather shortness of its coat,\nit is widely different from other short-haired varieties; yet there", " is\nbut little difference in its mode of life or habit. I have not had the\npleasure of owning one of", " this breed, though when on a visit to Lady\nDorothy Nevill, at Dangstein, near Petersfield, I had se", "veral\nopportunities for observation. I noticed in particular the intense\nliking of these cats for \"t", "he woods,\" not passing along the hedgerows\nlike the ordinary cat, but quickly and quietly creeping f", "rom bush to\nbush, then away in the shaws; not that they displayed a wildness of\nnature, in being shy", " or distrustful, nor did they seem to care about\ngetting wet like many cats do, though apparently th", "ey suffer much when\nit is cold and damp weather, as would be likely on account of the\nextreme shortn", "ess of their fur, which is of both a hairy and a woolly\ntexture, and not so glossy as our ordinary c", "ommon domestic cat, nor is\nthe tail, which is thin. Lady Dorothy Nevill informed me that those\nwhich", " belonged to her were imported from Siam and presented by Sir R.\nHerbert of the Colonial Office; the", " late Duke of Wellington imported the\nbreed, also Mr. Scott of Rotherfield. Lady Dorothy Nevill thou", "ght them\nexceedingly docile and domestic, but delicate in their constitution;\nalthough her ladyship ", "kept one for two years, another over a year, but\neventually all died of the same complaint, that of ", "worms, which\npermeated every part of their body.\n\nMr. Young, of Harrogate, possesses a chocolate var", "iety of this Royal\nSiamese cat; it was sent from Singapore to Mr. Brennand, from whom he\npurchased i", "t, and is described as \"most loving and affectionate,\" which\nI believe is usually the case. Although", " this peculiar colour is very\nbeautiful and scarce, I am of opinion that the light gray or fawn colo", "ur\nwith black and well-marked muzzle, ears, and legs is the typical\nvariety, the markings being the ", "same as the Himalayan rabbits. There are\ncavies so marked; and many years ago I saw a mouse similarl", "y coloured.\nMr. Young informs me that the kittens he has bred from his dark variety\nhave invariably ", "come the usual gray or light dun colour with dark\npoints. I therefore take that to be the correct fo", "rm and colour, and the\ndarker colour to be an accidental deviation. In pug-dogs such a depth of\ncolo", "ur would be considered a blemish, however beautiful it might be;\neven black pugs do not obtain prize", "s in competition with a true-marked\nlight dun; but whatever colour the body is it should be clear an", "d firm,\nrich and not clouded in any way. But I give Mr. Young's own views:\n\n\"The dun Siamese we have", " has won whenever shown; the body is of a dun\ncolour, nose, part of the face, ears, feet, and tail o", "f a very dark\nchocolate brown, nearly black, eyes of a beautiful blue by day, and of a\nred colour at", " night! My other prize cat is of a very rich chocolate or\nseal, with darker face, ears, and tail; th", "e legs are a shade darker,\nwhich intensifies towards the feet. The eyes small, of a rich amber\ncolou", "r, the ears are bare of hair, and not so much hair between the eyes\nand the ears as the English cats", " have. The dun, unless under special\njudges, invariably beats the chocolate at the shows. The tail i", "s shorter\nand finer than our English cats.\n\n\"I may add that we lately have had four kittens from the", " chocolate cat\nby a pure dun Siamese he-cat. All the young are dun coloured, and when\nborn were very", " light, nearly white, but are gradually getting the dark\npoints of the parents; in fact, I expect th", "at one will turn chocolate.\nThe cats are very affectionate, and make charming ladies' pets, but are\n", "rather more delicate than our cats, but after they have once wintered in\nEngland they seem to get ac", "climatised.\n\n\"Mr. Brennand, who brought the chocolate one and another, a male, from\nSingapore last y", "ear, informs me that there are two varieties, a large\nand small. Ours are the small; he also tells m", "e the chocolate is the\nmost rare.\n\n\"I have heard a little more regarding the Siamese cats from Miss ", "Walker,\nthe daughter of General Walker, who brought over one male and three\nfemales. It seems the on", "ly pure breed is kept at the King of Siam's\npalace, and the cats are very difficult to procure, for ", "in Siam it took\nthree different gentlemen of great influence three months before they\ncould get any.", "\n\n\"Their food is fish and rice boiled together until quite soft, and Miss\nWalker finds the kittens b", "red have thriven on it.\n\n\"It is my intention to try and breed from a white English female with\nblue ", "eyes, and a Siamese male.\n\n\"The Siamese cats are very prolific breeders, having generally five at\nea", "ch litter, and three litters a year.\n\n\"We have never succeeded in breeding any like our chocolate ca", "t; they\nall come fawn, with black or dark brown points; the last family are a\nlittle darker on their", " backs, which gives them a richer appearance than\nthe pale fawn. Hitherto we have never had any half", "-bred Siamese; but\nthere used to be a male Siamese at Hurworth-on-Tees, and there were many\nyoung br", "ed from English cats. They invariably showed the Siamese cross\nin the ground colour.\"\n\nFrom the fore", "going it will be seen how very difficult it is to obtain\nthe pure breed, even in Siam, and on refere", "nce to the Crystal Palace\ncatalogues from the year 1871 until 1887, I find that there were\n_fifteen_", " females and only _four_ males, and some of these were not\nentire; and I have always understood that", " the latter were not allowed to\nbe exported, and were only got by those so fortunate as a most\nextra", "ordinary favour, as the King of Siam is most jealous of keeping the\nbreed entirely in Siam as royal ", "cats.\n\nThe one exhibited by Lady Dorothy Nevill (Mrs. Poodle) had three kittens\nby an English cat; b", "ut none showed any trace of the Siamese, being all\ntabby.\n\nAlthough Mr. Herbert Young was informed b", "y Mr. Brennand that there is\nanother and a larger breed in Siam, it does not appear that any of thes", "e\nhave been imported; nor have we any description of them, either as to\ncolour, size, form, or quali", "ty of coat, or whether they resemble the\nlesser variety in this or any respect, yet it is to be hope", "d that, ere\nlong, some specimens may be secured for this country.\n\nBesides Mr. Herbert Young, I am a", "lso much indebted to the courtesy of\nMrs. Vyvyan, of Dover, who is a lover of this beautiful breed, ", "and who\nkindly sends the following information:\n\n\"The original pair were sent from Bangkok, and it i", "s believed that they\ncame from the King's Palace, where alone the breed are said to be kept\npure. At", " any rate they were procured as a great favour, after much delay\nand great difficulty, and since tha", "t time no others have been attainable\nby the same person. We were in China when they reached us, and", " the\nfollowing year, 1886, we brought the father, mother, and a pair of\nkittens to England.\n\n\"Their ", "habits are in general the same as the common cat, though it has\nbeen observed by strangers, 'there i", "s a pleasant wild animal odour,'\nwhich is not apparent to us.\n\n\"Most of the kittens have a kink in t", "he tail; it varies in position,\nsometimes in the middle, close to the body, or at the extreme end li", "ke a\nhook.\"\n\nThis tallies with the description given by Mr. Darwin of the Malayan and\nalso the Siame", "se cats. See my notes on the Manx cat. Mr. Young had also\nnoted this peculiarity in \"the Royal cat o", "f Siam.\"\n\nMrs. Vyvyan further remarks:\n\n\"They are very affectionate and personally attached to their", " human\nfriends, not liking to be left alone, and following us from room to room\nmore after the manne", "r of dogs than cats.\n\n\"They are devoted parents, the old father taking the greatest interest\nin the ", "young ones.\n\n\"They are friendly with the dogs of the house, occupying the same\nbaskets; but the male", "s are very strong, and fight with great persistency\nwith strange dogs, and conquer all other tom-cat", "s in their\nneighbourhood. We lost one, however, a very fine cat, in China in this\nway, as he returne", "d to the house almost torn to pieces and in a dying\ncondition, from an encounter with some animal wh", "ich we think was one of\nthe wild cats of the hills.\n\n\"We feed them on fresh fish boiled with rice, u", "ntil the two are nearly\namalgamated; they also take bread and milk _warm_, the milk having been\nboil", "ed, and this diet seems to suit them better than any other. They\nalso like chicken and game. We have", " proved the fish diet is not\nessential, as two of our cats (in Cornwall) never get it.\n\n\"Rather a fr", "ee life seems necessary to their perfect acclimatisation,\nwhere they can go out and provide themselv", "es with raw animal food,\n'feather and fur.'\n\n\"We find these cats require a great deal of care, unles", "s they live in\nthe country, and become hardy through being constantly out of doors. The\nkittens are ", "difficult to rear unless they are born late in the spring,\nthus having the warm weather before them.", " Most deaths occur before they\nare six months old.\n\n\"We have lost several kittens from worms, which ", "they endeavour to vomit;\nas relief we give them raw chicken heads, with _the feathers on_, with\nsucc", "ess. We also give cod-liver oil, if the appetite fails and weight\ndiminishes.\n\n\"When first born the ", "colour is nearly pure white, the only trace of\n'points' being a fine line of dark gray at the edge o", "f the ears; a\ngradual alteration takes place, the body becoming creamy, the ears,\nface, tail, and fe", "et darkening, until, about a year old, they attain\nperfection, when the points should be the deepest", " brown, nearly black,\nand the body ash or fawn colour, eyes opal or blue, looking red in the\ndark. A", "fter maturity they are apt to darken considerably, though not in\nall specimens.\n\n\"They are most inte", "resting and delightful pets. But owing to their\ndelicacy and the great care they require, no one, un", "less a real cat\n_lover_, should attempt to keep them; they cannot with safety to their\nhealth be tre", "ated as common cats.\n\n\"During 'Susan's' (one of the cats) illness, the old he-cat came daily\nto cond", "ole with her, bringing delicate 'attentions' in the form of\nfreshly-caught mice. 'Loquat' also provi", "ded this for a young family for\nwhom she had no milk.\n\n\"Another, 'Saiwan,' is very clever at undoing", " the latch of the window in\norder to let himself out; tying it up with string is of no use, and he\nh", "as even managed to untwist wire that has been used to prevent his going\nout in the snow. We have at ", "present two males, four adult females, and\nfive kittens.\" One of our kittens sent to Scotland last A", "ugust, has done\nwell.\n\nMrs. Lee, of Penshurst, also has some fine specimens of the breed, and\nof the", " same colours as described. I take it, therefore, that the true\nbreed, by consensus of opinion, is t", "hat of the dun, fawn, or\nash-coloured ground, with black points. Other colours should be shown in\nth", "e variety classes.\n\nThe head should be long from the ears to the eyes, and not over broad,\nand then ", "rather sharply taper off towards the muzzle, the forehead flat,\nand receding, the eyes somewhat asla", "nt downwards towards the nose, and\nthe eyes of a pearly, yet bright blue colour, the ears usual size", " and\nblack, with little or no hair on the inside, with black muzzle, and\nround the eyes black. The f", "orm should be slight, graceful, and\ndelicately made, body long, tail rather short and thin, and the ", "legs\nsomewhat short, slender, and the feet oval, not so round as the ordinary\nEnglish cat. The body ", "should be one bright, uniform, even colour, not\nclouded, either rich fawn, dun, or ash. The legs, fe", "et, and tail black.\nThe back slightly darker is allowable, if of a rich colour, and the\ncolour softe", "ned, _not clouded_.\n\n[Illustration: PROPERLY MARKED SIAMESE CAT.]\n\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nTHE MANX CAT.", "\n\n\nThe Manx cat is well known, and is by no means uncommon. It differs\nchiefly from the ordinary dom", "estic cat in being tailless, or nearly so,\nthe best breeds not having any; the hind legs are thicker", " and rather\nlonger, particularly in the thighs. It runs more like a hare than a cat,\nthe action of t", "he legs being awkward, nor does it seem to turn itself so\nreadily, or with such rapidity and ease; t", "he head is somewhat small for\nits size, yet thick and well set on a rather long neck; the eyes large", ",\nround, and full, ears medium, and rather rounded at the apex. In colour\nthey vary, but I do not re", "member to have seen a white or many black,\nthough one of the best that has come under my notice was ", "the latter\ncolour. I have examined a number of specimens sent for exhibition at the\nCrystal Palace a", "nd other cat shows, and found in some a very short,\nthin, twisted tail, in others a mere excrescence", ", and some with an\nappendage more like a knob. These I have taken as having been operated\nupon when ", "young, the tail being removed, but this may not be the case,\nas Mr. St. George Mivart in his very va", "luable book on the cat, mentions\na case where a female cat had her tail so injured by the passage of", " a\ncart-wheel over it, that her master judged it best to have it cut off\nnear the base. Since then s", "he has had two litters of kittens, and in\neach litter one or more of the kittens had a _stump of tai", "l_, while\ntheir brothers and sisters had tails of the usual length. But were there\nno Manx cats in t", "he neighbourhood, is a query. This case is analogous to\nthe statement that the short-tailed sheep-do", "g was produced from parents\nthat had had their tails amputated; and yet this is now an established\nb", "reed. Also a small black breed of dogs from the Netherlands, which is\nnow very fashionable. They are", " called \"Chipperkes,\" and have no tails,\nat least when exhibited. Mr. St. George Mivart further stat", "es that Mr.\nBartlett told him, as he has so stated to myself, that in the Isle of\nMan the cats have ", "tails of different lengths, from nothing up to ten\ninches. I have also been informed on good authori", "ty that the Fox Terrier\ndogs, which invariably have (as a matter of fashion) their tails cut\nshort, ", "sometimes have puppies with much shorter tails than the original\nbreed; but this does not appear to ", "take effect on sheep, whose tails are\ngenerally cut off. I cannot, myself, come to the same conclusi", "on as to\nthe origin of the Manx cat. Be this as it may, one thing is certain:\nthat cross-bred Manx w", "ith other cats often have young that are tailless.\nAs a proof of this, Mr. Herbert Young, of Harroga", "te, has had in his\npossession a very fine red female long-haired tailless cat, that was\nbred between", " the Manx and a Persian. Another case showing the strong\nprepotency of the Manx cat. Mr. Hodgkin, of", " Eridge, some time ago had a\nfemale Manx cat sent to him. Not only does she produce tailless cats\nwh", "en crossed with the ordinary cat, but the progeny again crossed also\nfrequently have some tailless k", "ittens in each litter. I have also been\ntold there is a breed of tailless cats in Cornwall. Mr. Darw", "in states in\nhis book on \"The Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication,\"\nvol. i. p. 47, t", "hat \"throughout an immense area, namely, the Malayan\nArchipelago, Siam, Pequan, and Burmah, all the ", "cats have truncated tails\nabout half the proper length, often with a sort of knob at the end.\"\nThis ", "description tallies somewhat with the appearance of some of the\nSiamese cats that have been imported", ", several of which, though they have\nfairly long and thin tails, and though they are much pointed at", " the end,\noften have a break or kink. In a note Mr. Darwin says, \"The Madagascar\ncat is said to have", " a twisted tail.\" (See Desmares, in Encyclop. Nat.\nMamm., 1820, p. 233, for some other breeds.) Mr. ", "St. George Mivart also\ncorroborates the statement, so far as the Malay cat is concerned. He\nsays the", " tail is only half the ordinary length, and often contorted into\na sort of knot, so that it cannot b", "e straightened. He further states,\n\"Its contortion is due to deformity of the bones of the tail,\" an", "d there\nis a tailless breed of cats in the Crimea. Some of the Manx cats I have\nexamined have precis", "ely the kind of tail here described--thin, very\nshort, and twisted, that cannot be straightened. Is ", "it possible that the\nManx cat originated from the Malayan? Or rather is it a freak of nature\nperpetu", "ated by selection? Be this as it may, we have the Manx cat now as\na distinct breed, and, when crosse", "d with others, will almost always\nproduce some entirely tailless kittens, if not all. Many of the Si", "amese\nkittens bred here have kinks in their tails.\n\nThe illustration I give is that of a prize winne", "r at the Crystal Palace\nin 1880, 1881, 1882, and is the property of Mr. J. M. Thomas, of\nParliament ", "Street. In colour it is a brindled tortoiseshell. It is eight\nyears old. At the end of this descript", "ion I also give a portrait of one\nof its kittens, a tabby; both are true Manx, and neither have a pa", "rticle\nof tail, only a very small tuft of hair which is boneless. The hind\nquarters are very square ", "and deep, as contrasted with other cats, and\nthe flank deeper, giving an appearance of great strengt", "h, the hind legs\nbeing longer, and thicker in proportion to the fore legs, which are much\nslighter a", "nd tapering; even the toes are smaller. The head is round for\na she-cat, and the ears somewhat large", " and pointed, but thin and fine in\nthe hair, the cavity of the ear has _less hair within it_ (also a", " trait\nof the Siamese) than some other short-haired cats, the neck is long and\nthin, as are the shou", "lders. Its habits are the same as those of most\ncats. I may add that Mr. Thomas, who is an old frien", "d of mine, has had\nthis breed many years, and kept it perfectly pure.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nVARIOUS CO", "LOURS.\n\n\nThose who have had much to do with breeding, and crossing of animals,\nbirds, or plants, wel", "l know that with time, leisure, and patience, how\ncomparatively easy it is to improve, alter, enlarg", "e, or diminish any of\nthese, or any part of them; and looking at the cat from this standpoint,\nnow t", "hat it is becoming \"a fancy\" animal, there is no prophesying what\nforms, colours, markings, or other", " variations will be made by those who\nunderstand what can be done by careful, well-considered matchi", "ng, and\nskilful selection. We have now cats with no tails, short tails, and some\nof moderate length,", " long tails bushy and hairy; but should a very long\ntail be in request, I have no doubt whatever but", " that in a few years it\nwould be produced; and now that there is a cat club constituted for the\nwelf", "are and improvement of the condition, as well as the careful\nbreeding of cats, curious and unforesee", "n results are most likely to be\nattained; but whether any will ever excel the many beautiful varieti", "es\nwe now have, is a problem that remains to be solved.\n\nThis concludes the numerous varieties of _c", "olours_ and the proper\nmarkings of the domestic cat, as regards beauty and the points of\nexcellence ", "to be observed for the purposes of exhibition. These are\ndistinct, and as such, nearly all have clas", "ses for each individual\ncolour and marking, and therefore it is imperative that the owner should\nnot", "e carefully the different properties and beauties of his or her\nparticular specimen, and also as car", "efully read the schedule of prizes\nwith such attention as to be enabled to enter his or her pet in t", "he\nproper class; for, it is not only annoying to the exhibitor but to the\njudge to find an animal so", "metimes of extraordinary merit placed in the\n\"wrong class\" by _sheer inattention_ to the _printed ru", "les_ and\ninstructions prepared by the committee or promoters of the show. It is\nexceedingly distaste", "ful, and I may say almost distressing, to a judge\nto find a splendid animal wrongly entered, and so ", "to feel himself\ncompelled to \"pass it,\" and to affix the words fatal to all chance of\nwinning--\"Wron", "g class.\" Again let me impress on exhibitors to be\ncareful--very careful--in this matter--this matte", "r of entry--for I may\nsay it is one of the reasons which has led to my placing these notes on\npaper,", " though I have done so with much pleasure, and with earnest hope\nthat they will be found of some val", "ue and service to the \"uninitiated.\"\n\nOf course there are, as there must be, a number of beautiful s", "hades of\ncolour, tints, and markings that are difficult to define or describe;\ncolours and markings ", "that are intermediate with those noticed; but\nthough in themselves they are extremely interesting, a", "nd even very\nbeautiful, they do not come within the range of the classes for certain\ndefinite forms ", "of lines, spots, or colourings, as I have endeavoured to\npoint out, and, indeed, it was almost impos", "sible to make a sufficient\nnumber of classes to comprehend the whole. Therefore it has been\nconsider", "ed wisest and even necessary as the most conducive to the best\ninterests of the exhibitor and also t", "o simplify the difficulties of\njudging, and for the maintenance of the various forms of beauty of th", "e\ncat, to have classes wherein they are shown under rules of colour,\npoints of beauty and excellence", " that are \"hard and fast,\" and by this\nmeans all may not only know how and in what class to exhibit,", " but also\nwhat their chance is of \"taking honours.\"\n\nAs I have just stated, there are intermediate c", "olours, markings, and\nforms, so extra classes have been provided for these, under the heading\nof \"an", "y other variety of colour,\" and \"any other variety not before\nmentioned,\" and \"any cats of peculiar ", "structure.\" In this last case, the\ncats that have abnormal formations, such as seven toes, or even n", "ine on\ntheir fore and hind legs, peculiar in other ways, such as three legs, or\nonly two legs, as I ", "have seen, may be exhibited. I regard these,\nhowever, as malformations, and not to be encouraged, be", "ing generally\ndevoid of beauty, and lacking interest for the ordinary observer, and\nthey also tend t", "o create a morbid taste for the unnatural and ugly,\ninstead of the beautiful; the beautiful, be it w", "hat it may, is always\npleasant to behold; and there is but little, if any, doubt in my mind\nbut that", " the constant companionship of even a beautiful cat must have a\nsoothing effect. Therefore, not in c", "ats only, but in all things have the\nfinest and best. Surround yourself with the elegant, the gracef", "ul, the\nbrilliant, the beautiful, the agile, and the gentle. Be it what it may,\nanimal, bird, or flo", "wer, be careful to have the best. A man, it is said,\nis made more or less by his environments, and d", "oubtless this is to a\ngreat extent, if not entirely, a fact; that being so, the contemplation\nof the", " beautiful must have its quieting, restful influences, and tend to\na brighter and happier state of e", "xistence. I am fully aware there are\nmany that may differ from me, though I feel sure I am not far w", "rong when\nI aver there are few animals really more beautiful than a cat. If it is\na good, carefully ", "selected specimen, well kept, well cared for, in high\ncondition, in its prime of life, well-trained,", " graceful in every line,\nbright in colour, distinct in markings, supple and elegant in form,\nagile a", "nd gentle in its ways, it is beautiful to look at and must\ncommand admiration. Yes! the contemplatio", "n of the beautiful elevates the\nmind, if only in a cat; beauty of any kind, is beauty, and has its\nr", "efining influences.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nUSEFULNESS OF CATS.\n\n\nIn our urban and suburban houses what ", "should we do without cats? In our\nsitting or bedrooms, our libraries, in our kitchens and storerooms", ", our\nfarms, barns, and rickyards, in our docks, our granaries, our ships, and\nour wharves, in our c", "orn markets, meat markets, and other places too\nnumerous to mention, how useful they are! In our shi", "ps, however, the\nrats oft set them at defiance; still they are of great service.\n\nHow wonderfully pa", "tient is the cat when watching for rats or mice,\nawaiting their egress from their place of refuge or", " that which is their\nhome! How well Shakespeare in _Pericles_, Act iii., describes this keen\nattenti", "on of the cat to its natural pursuit!\n\n    The cat, with eyne of burning coal,\n    Now crouches from", " (before) the mouse's hole.\n\nA slight rustle, and the fugitive comes forth; a quick, sharp, resolute", "\nmotion, and the cat has proved its usefulness. Let any one have a plague\nof rats and mice, as I onc", "e had, and let them be delivered therefrom by\ncats, as I was, and they will have a lasting and kind ", "regard for them.\n\nA friend not long since informed me that a cat at Stone's Distillery was\nseen to c", "atch two rats at one time, a fore foot on each. All the cats\nkept at this establishment, and there a", "re several, are of the red tabby\ncolour, and therefore most likely all males.\n\nI am credibly informe", "d of a still more extraordinary feat of a cat in\ncatching mice, that of a red tabby cat which on bei", "ng taken into a\ngranary at Sevenoaks where there were a number of mice, dashed in among\na retreating", " group, and secured four, one with each paw and two in her\nmouth.\n\nAt the office of _The Morning Adv", "ertiser_, I am informed by my old\nfriend Mr. Charles Williams, they boast of a race of cats bred the", "re for\nnearly half a century. In colour these are mostly tortoiseshell, and\nsome are very handsome.\n", "\nThe Government, mindful also of their utility, pay certain sums, which\nare regularly passed through", " the accounts quarterly, for the purpose of\nproviding and keeping cats in our public offices, dockya", "rds, stores,\nshipping, etc., thereby proving, if proof were wanting, their\nacknowledged worth.\n\nIn V", "ienna four cats are employed by the town magistrates to catch mice\non the premises of the municipali", "ty. A regular allowance is voted for\ntheir keep, and, after a limited period of active service, they", " are\nplaced on the \"retired list,\" with a comfortable pension.\n\n       *       *       *       *    ", "   *\n\nThere are also a number of cats in the service of the United States Post\nOffice. These cats ar", "e distributed over the different offices to protect\nthe bags from being eaten by rats and mice, and ", "the cost of providing\nfor them is duly inscribed in the accounts. When a birth takes place,\nthe loca", "l postmaster informs the district superintendent of the fact,\nand obtains an addition to his rations", ".\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA short time ago, the budget of the Imperial Printing O", "ffice in France,\namongst other items, contained one for cats, which caused some merriment\nin the leg", "islative chamber during its discussion. According to the\n_Pays_ these cats are kept for the purpose ", "of destroying the numerous\nrats and mice which infest the premises, and cause considerable damage\nto", " the large stock of paper which is always stored there. This feline\nstaff is fed twice a day, and a ", "man is employed to look after them; so\nthat for cats' meat and the keeper's salary no little expense", " is\nannually incurred; sufficient, in fact, to form a special item in the\nnational expenditure.\n\nMr.", " W. M. Acworth, in his excellent book, \"The Railways of England,\"\ngives a very interesting account o", "f the usefulness of the cat. He says,\nwriting of the Midland Railway: \"A few miles further off, howe", "ver--at\nTrent--is a still more remarkable portion of the company's staff, eight\ncats, who are borne ", "on the strength of the establishment, and for whom a\nsufficient allowance of milk and cats' meat is ", "provided. And when we say\nthat the cats have under their charge, according to the season of the\nyear", ", from one to three or four hundred thousand empty corn sacks, it\nwill be admitted that the company ", "cannot have many servants who better\nearn their wages.\n\n\"The holes in the sacks, which are eaten by ", "the rats which are not\nkilled by the cats, are darned by twelve women, who are employed by the\ncompa", "ny.\"\n\nFew people know, or wish to know, what a boon to mankind is \"The\nDomestic Cat.\" Liked or disli", "ked, there is the cat, in some cases\nunthought of or uncared for, but simply kept on account of the\n", "devastation that would otherwise take place were rats and mice allowed\nto have undivided possession.", " An uncle of mine had some hams sent from\nYorkshire; during the transit by rail the whole of the int", "erior of one\nof the largest was consumed by rats. More cats at the stations would\npossibly have prev", "ented such irritating damage.\n\nAnd further, it is almost incredible, and likewise almost unknown, th", "e\ngreat benefit the cat is to the farmer. All day they sleep in the barns,\nstables, or outhouses, am", "ong the hay or straw. At eve they are seen\nabout the rick-yard, the corn-stack, the cow and bullock ", "yards, the\nstables, the gardens, and the newly sown or mown fields, in quest of\ntheir natural prey, ", "the rat and mouse. In the fields the mice eat and\ncarry off the newly-sown peas or corn, so in the g", "arden, or the ripened\ngarnered corn in stacks; but when the cat is on guard much of this is\nprevente", "d. Rats eat corn and carry off more, kill whole broods of\nducklings and chickens in a night, undermi", "ne buildings, stop drains, and\nunwittingly do much other injury to the well-being of the farmers and", "\nothers. What a ruinous thing it would be, and what a dreadfully horrible\nthing it is to be overrun ", "with rats, to say nothing of mice. In this\nmatter man's best friend is the cat. Silent, careful, cau", "tious, and\nsure, it is at work, while the owner sleeps, with an industry, a will,\nand purpose that n", "ever rests nor tires from dewy eve till rosy morn,\nwhen it will glide through \"the cat hole\" into th", "e barn for repose among\nthe straw, and when night comes, forth again; its usefulness scarcely\nimagin", "ed, much less known and appreciated.\n\nThey who remember old Fleet Prison, in Farringdon Street, will", " scarcely\nbelieve that the debtors there confined were at times so neglected as to\nbe absolutely sta", "rving; so much so, that a Mr. Morgan, a surgeon of\nLiverpool, being put into that prison, was ultima", "tely reduced so low by\npoverty, neglect, and hunger, as to catch mice by the means of a cat for\nhis ", "sustenance. This is stated to be the fact in a book written by Moses\nPitt, \"The Cries of the Oppress", "ed,\" 1691.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nGENERAL MANAGEMENT.\n\nFEEDING.\n\n\nAdult cats require less food in propo", "rtion than kittens, for two\nreasons. One is this: a kitten is growing, and therefore extra bone,\nfle", "sh, skin, hair, and all else has to be provided for; while in the\nadults, these are more or less acq", "uired, and also they procure for\nthemselves, in various ways in country or suburban localities, much", " live\nand other food, and no animal is the better for over or excessive\nfeeding, especially if confi", "ned, or its chances of exercise contracted.\n\nI have tried many ways or methods of feeding, biscuits ", "of sorts, liver,\nlights, horseflesh, bread and milk, rice, fish, and cat mixtures, but\nhave always a", "ttained the best results by giving new milk as drink, and\nraw shin of beef for food, with grass, boi", "led asparagus stems,\ncabbage-lettuce, or some other vegetable, either cooked or fresh. Good\nhorsefle", "sh is much liked by the cat, and it thrives well on it. I do not\nbelieve in either liver or lights a", "s a flesh or bone maker. Besides the\nbeef, there are the \"tit-bits\" that the household cat not only ", "usually\nreceives, but looks for or expects.\n\nMy dear friend, Mr. John Timbs, in \"Things not Generall", "y Known,\" avers\nthat cats are not so fond of fish as flesh, and that the statement that\nthey are is ", "a fallacy. He says, put both before them and they will take\nthe flesh first, and this I have found t", "o be correct. I should only give\nfresh fish, as a rule, to a cat when unwell, more as an alternative", " than\nfood.\n\nAs raw meat or other raw food is natural to the cat, it is far the best,\nwith vegetable", "s, for keeping the body, coat, and skin in good condition\nand health, and the securing of a rich, br", "ight, high colour and quality.\nOn no account try to improve these by either medicinal liquids, pills", ",\nor condiments; nothing can be much worse, as reflection will prove. If\nthe cat is healthy, it is a", "t its best, and will keep so by proper food;\nif unwell, then use such medicines as the disease or co", "mplaint it\nsuffers from requires, _and not otherwise_. Many horses and other\nanimals have their cons", "titutions entirely ruined by what are called\n\"coat tonics,\" which are useless, and only believed in ", "and practised by\nthe thoughtless, gullible, and foolish. Does any one, or will any one\ntake pills, p", "owders, or liquids, for promoting the colour or texture of\ntheir hair; would any one be so silly? An", "d yet we are coolly told to\ngive such things to our animals. Granted that in illness medicine is of\n", "much service, in health it is harmful, and tends to promote disease\nwhere none exists.\n\n\nSLEEPING PL", "ACES.\n\nI much prefer a round basket filled with oat straw to anything else;\nsome urge that a box is ", "better; my cats have a basket. It is well to\nsprinkle the straw occasionally with Keating's Powder o", "r flour of\nsulphur, which is a preventive of insect annoyances, and \"Prevention is\nbetter than cure.", "\"\n\nNever shut cats up in close cupboards for the night, there being little\nor no ventilation; it is ", "most injurious, pure air being as essential to\na cat as to a human being.\n\nAlways have a box with dr", "y earth near the cat's sleeping place, unless\nthere is an opening for egress near.\n\nDo not, as a rul", "e, put either collar or ribbon on your cat; though they\nmay thereby be improved in appearance, they ", "are too apt to get entangled\nor caught by the collar, and often strangulation ensues; besides which,", "\nin long-haired cats, it spoils their mane or frill. Of course at shows\nit is allowable.\n\nAll cats, ", "as well as other animals, should have ready access to a pan of\nclear water, which should be changed ", "every day, and the pan cleaned.\n\nFresh air, sunlight, and warm sunshine are good, both for cats and ", "their\nowners.\n\nIt is related of Charles James Fox that, walking up St. James's Street\nfrom one of th", "e club-houses with the Prince of Wales, he laid a wager\nthat he would see more cats than the Prince ", "in his walk, and that he\nmight take which side of the street he liked. When they reached the top,\nit", " was found that Mr. Fox had seen thirteen cats, and the Prince not\none. The Royal personage asked fo", "r an explanation of this apparent\nmiracle. Mr. Fox said: \"Your Royal Highness took, of course, the s", "hady\nside of the way as most agreeable; I knew the sunny side would be left\nfor me, and _cats always", " prefer the sunshine_.\"\n\nA most essential requisite for the health of the cat is cleanliness. In\nits", "elf the animal is particularly so, as may be observed by its constant\nhabit of washing, or cleaning ", "its fur many times a day; therefore, a\nclean basket, clean straw, or clean flannel, to lie on--in fa", "ct,\neverything clean is not only necessary, but is a necessity for its\nabsolute comfort.\n\nMr. Timbs ", "says: \"It is equally erroneous that she is subject to fleas;\nthe small insect, which infests the hal", "f-grown kitten, being a totally\ndifferent animal, exceedingly swift in running, but not salient or\nl", "eaping like a flea.\"\n\nIn this Mr. Timbs slightly errs. Cats _do_ have fleas, but not often,\nand of a", " different kind to the ordinary flea; but I have certainly seen\nthem jump.\n\nIn dressing the coat of ", "the cat no comb should be used, more especially\nwith the long-haired varieties; but if so, which I d", "o not recommend,\ngreat care should be used not to drag the hair so that it comes out, or\nbreaks, oth", "erwise a rough, uneven coat will and must be the result.\n\nShould the hair become clotted, matted, or", " felted, as is sometimes the\ncase, it ought to be moistened, either with oil or soft-soap, a little\n", "water being added, and when the application has well soaked in, it will\nbe found comparatively easy ", "to separate the tangle with the fingers by\ngently pulling out from the mass a few hairs at a time, a", "fter which wash\nthoroughly, and use a soft, long-haired brush; but this must be done\nwith discretion", ", so as not to spoil the natural waviness of the hair, or\nto make it lie in breadths instead of the ", "natural, easy,\ncarelessly-parted flaky appearance, which shows the white or blue cat\noff to such adv", "antage.\n\n\nWASHING.\n\nMost cats have a dislike to water, and as a rule, and under ordinary\nconditions,", " generally keep themselves clean, more especially the\nshort-haired breeds; but, as is well known, th", "e Angora, Persian, and\nRussian, if not taken care of, are sure to require washing, the more so\nto pr", "epare them for exhibition, as there is much gain in the condition\nin which a cat comes before the ju", "dge.\n\nThere are many cases of cats taking to the water and swimming to certain\npoints to catch fish,", " or for other food, on record; yet it is seldom\nthat they take a pleasure in playing about in it. I ", "therefore think it\nwell to mention that I had a half-bred black and white Russian, that\nwould freque", "ntly jump into the bath while it was being filled, and sit\nthere until the water rose too high for i", "ts safety. Thus cats may be\ntaught to like washing.\n\nIf a cat is to be washed, treat it as kindly an", "d gently as is possible,\nspeaking in a soothing tone, and in no way be hasty or sudden in your\nmovem", "ents, so as to raise distrust or fear. Let the water be warm but\nnot hot, put the cat in slowly, and", " when its feet rest on the bottom of\nthe tub, you may commence the washing.\n\nMr. A. A. Clarke, the w", "ell-known cat fancier, says: \"I seldom wash my\ncats, I rather prefer giving them a good clean straw-", "bed, and attending\nto their general health and condition, and they will then very seldom\nrequire was", "hing. I find that much washing makes the coat harsh and poor,\nand I also know from experience that i", "t is 'a work of art' to wash a\ncat properly, and requires an artist in that way to do it. My plan is", " to\nprepare some liquid soap, by cutting a piece into shreds, and putting it\ninto cold water, and th", "en boiling it for an hour. I then have two clean\ntubs got ready, one to wash, the other to rinse in.", " Have soft water\nabout blood heat, with a very small piece of soda in the washing-tub,\ninto which I ", "place the cat, hind-quarters first, having some one that it\nknows perfectly well, to hold and talk t", "o the cat while the washing is\ngoing on. I begin with the tail, and thoroughly rubbing in the soap w", "ith\nmy hands, and getting by degrees over the body and shoulders up to the\nears, leaving the head un", "til the cat is rinsed in the other tub, which\nought to be half filled with warm soft water, into whi", "ch I place the\ncat, and thoroughly rinse out all the soap, when at the same time I wash\nthe head, an", "d I then sit in front of the fire and dry with warm towels;\nand if it is done well and thoroughly, i", "t is a good three hours' hard\nwork.\"\n\nI would add to the foregoing that I should use Naldire's dog s", "oap, which\nI have found excellent in all ways, and it also destroys any insect life\nthat may be pres", "ent.\n\nAlso in washing, be careful not to move the hands in circles, or the\nhair will become entangle", "d and knotty, and very difficult to untwist or\nunravel. Take the hair in the hands, and press the so", "ftened soap through\nand through the interstices, and when rinsing do the same with the\nwater, using ", "a large sponge for the purpose. After drying I should put\nthe cat in a box lightly, full of oat stra", "w, and place it in front of,\nor near a fire, at such distance as not to become too warm, and only\nne", "ar enough to prevent a chill before the cat is thoroughly dry.\n\n\nMATING.\n\n    Yet nature is made bet", "ter by no mean,\n    But nature makes that mean: so, o'er that art,\n    Which, you say, adds to natur", "e, is an art\n    That nature makes.\n\n                                    _Coriolanus, Act II. Scene ", "I._\n\nThis requires much and careful consideration, and in this, as well as in\nmany other things, exp", "erience and theory join hands, while the knowledge\nof the naturalist and fancier is of great and sup", "erlative value; yet,\nwith all combined, anything like certainty can never be assured,\nalthough the p", "ossession of pedigree is added, and the different\nproperties of food, health, quality, and breed und", "erstood and taken into\naccount. Still, much may be gained by continued observation and close\nstudy o", "f the peculiar properties of colour, besides that of form. If,\nfor instance, a really, absolutely _b", "lue_ cat, without a shade of any\nother colour, were obtainable, and likewise a pure, clear, canary\ny", "ellow, there is little doubt that at a distant period, a green would be\nthe ultimate goal of success", ". But the yellow tabby is not a yellow, nor\nthe blue a blue. There being, then, only a certain varie", "ty of colours in\ncats, the tints to be gained are limited entirely to a certain set of\nsuch colours,", " and the numerous shades and half-shades of these mixed,\nbroken, or not, into tints, markings light ", "or dark, as desired. To all\ncolour arrangements, if I may so call them, by the mind, intellect, or\nh", "and of man, there is a limit, beyond which none can go. It is thus far\nand no further.\n\nThere is the", " black cat, and the white; and between these are intervening\nshades, from very light, or white-gray,", " to darker, blue, dark blue,\nblackish blue, gray and black. If a blue-black is used, the lighter\ncol", "ours are of one tint; if a brown-black, they are another.\n\nThen in what are termed the sandies and b", "rowns, it commences with the\nyellow-white tint scarcely visible apart from white to the uninitiated\n", "eye; then darker and darker, until it culminates in deep brown, with the\nintervening yellows, reds, ", "chestnuts, mahoganys, and such colours, which\ngenerally are striped with a darker colour of nearly t", "heir own shade,\nuntil growing denser, it ends in brown-black.\n\nThe gray tabby has a ground colour of", " gray. In this there are the\nvarious shades from little or no markings, leaving the colour a brown o", "r\ngray, or the gray gradually disappearing before the advance of the black\nin broader and broader ba", "nds, until the first is excluded and black is\nthe result.\n\nThe tortoiseshell is a mixture of colours", " in patches, and is certainly\nan exhibition of what may be done by careful selection, mating, and\ncr", "ossing of an animal while under the control of man, in a state of\nthorough domestication. What the a", "lmond tumbler is to the pigeon\nfancier, so is the tortoiseshell cat to the cat fancier, or the bizar", "re\ntulip to the florist. As regards colour, it is a triumph of art over\nnature, by the means of skil", "ful, careful mating, continued with\nunwearying patience. We get the same combination of colour in th", "e\nguinea-pig, both male and female, and therefore this is in part a proof\nthat by proper mating, eve", "ntually a tortoiseshell male cat should soon\nbe by no means a rarity. There are rules, which, if str", "ictly followed\nunder favourable conditions, ought to produce certain properties, such\nproperties tha", "t may be desired, either by foolish (which generally it\nis) fashion, or the production of absolute b", "eauty of form, markings in\ncolours, or other brilliant effects, and which the true fanciers\nendeavou", "r to obtain. It is to this latter I shall address my remarks,\nrather than to the reproduction of the", " curious, the inelegant, or the\ndeformed, such as an undesirable number of toes, which are impedimen", "ts\nto utility.\n\nIn the first place, the fancier must thoroughly make up his mind as to\nthe variety o", "f form, colour, association of colours or markings by\nwhich he wishes to produce, if possible, perfe", "ction; and, having done\nso, he must provide himself with such stock as, on being mated, are\nlikely t", "o bring such progeny as will enable him in due time to attain\nthe end he has in view. This being gai", "ned, he must also prepare himself\nfor many disappointments, which are the more likely to accrue from", " the\nreason that, in all probability, he starts without any knowledge of the\nancestry or pedigree of", " the animals with which he begins his operations.\nTherefore, for this reason, he has to gain his kno", "wledge of any aptitude\nfor divergence from the ordinary or the common they may exhibit, or\nwhich his", " practical experience discovers, and thus, as it were, build up\na family with certain points and qua", "lities before he can actually embark\nin the real business of accurately matching and crossing so as ", "to\nproduce the results which, by a will, undeviating perseverance, and\npatience, he is hoping to gai", "n eventually--the perfection he so long,\nardently, and anxiously seeks to acquire; but he must bear ", "in mind that\nthat, on which he sets his mark, though high, must come within the\nlimits and compass o", "f that which _is_ attainable, for it is not the\nslightest use to attempt that which is not within th", "e charmed circle of\npossibilities.\n\n\nTORTOISESHELLS.\n\nI place these first on the list because, being", " an old pigeon fancier and\nsomewhat of a florist, I deem these to be the breed wherein there is the\n", "most art and skill required to produce properly all the varied mottled\nbeauty of bright colours that", " a cat of this breed should possess; and\nthose who have bred tortoiseshells well know how difficult ", "a task it is.\n\nIn breeding for this splendid, gorgeous, and diversified arrangement of\ncolouring, a ", "black, or even a blue, may be used with a yellow or red\ntabby female, or a white male, supposing eit", "her or both were the\noffspring of a tortoiseshell mother. The same males might be used with\nadvantag", "e with a tortoiseshell female. This is on the theory of whole\ncolours, and patches or portions of wh", "ole colours, without bars or\nmarkings when possible. In the same way some of the best almond tumbler", "\npigeons are bred from an almond cock mated to a yellow hen. The\ndifficulty here, until lately, has ", "been to breed hens of the varied\nmottling on almond colour, the hen almost invariably coming nearly,", " if\nnot quite yellow--so much so that forty to fifty years ago a yellow hen\nwas considered as a pair", " to an almond cock, in the same way as the red\ntabby male is now regarded in respect to the tortoise", "shell female; and\nit was not until at Birmingham, many years ago, when acting as judge, I\nrefused to", " award prizes to them as such, that the effort was made, and a\nsuccessful one, to breed almond-colou", "red hens with the same plumage as\nthe cock--that is, the three colours. With cats the matter is enti", "rely\ndifferent, it being the male at present that is the difficulty, if a\nreal difficulty it may be ", "called.\n\nMr. Herbert Young, a most excellent cat fancier and authority on the\nsubject, is of opinion", " that if a tortoiseshell male cat could be found,\nit would not prove fertile with a tortoiseshell fe", "male. But of this I am\nvery doubtful, because, if the red and the yellow tabby is so, which is\ndecid", "edly a weaker colour, I do not see how it can possess more vitality\nthan a cat marked with the _thre", "e_ colours; in fact the latter ought, in\nreality, to be more prolific, having black as one of the co", "lours, which\nis a strong colour, blue being only the weak substitute, or with white\n_combined_. A wh", "ole black is one of the strongest colours and most\npowerful of cats.\n\nReverting once again to the pi", "geon fancier by way of analogy, take, as\nan instance, what is termed the silver-coloured pigeon, or ", "the yellow.\nThese two, and duns, are, by loss of certain pigments, differently\ncoloured and constitu", "ted (like the tortoiseshell among cats) from other\nvarieties of pigeons of harder colours, such as b", "lues, and blacks, or\neven reds. For a long time silver turbit cock pigeons were so scarce\nthat, unti", "l I bred some myself, I had never seen such a thing; yet hens\nwere common enough, and got from silve", "r and blues. In the nestling\nbefore the feathers come, the young of these colours are without down,\n", "and are thus thought to be, and doubtless are, a weakly breed; yet there\nis no absolute diminution o", "f strength, beyond that of colour, when\nsilver is matched to silver; but dun with dun, these last go", " lower in\nthe scale, losing the black tint, and not unfrequently the colour is\nyellow; or, matched w", "ith black, breed true blacks. I am, therefore, of\nopinion that a tortoiseshell male and female would", ", and should, produce\nthe best of tortoiseshells, both male and female.\n\nIt not unfrequently happens", " that from a tortoiseshell mother, in the\nlitter of kittens there are male blacks and clear whites, ", "and I have\nknown of one case when a good blue and one where the mixed colours were\nblue, light red, ", "and light yellow were produced, while the sisters in\nthe litter were of the usual pure tortoiseshell", " markings. In such cases,\ngenerally, the latter only are kept, unless it is the blue, the others\nbei", "ng too often destroyed. My own plan would be to breed from such black\nor white males, and if not suc", "cessful in the first attempt, to breed\nagain in the same way with the young obtained with such cross", "; and I\nhave but little doubt that, by so doing, the result so long sought after\nwould be achieved. ", "At least, I deem it far more likely to be so than the\npresent plan of using the red tabby as the mal", "e, which are easily\nproduced, though very few are of high excellence in richness of ground\ntints.\n\n\n", "TORTOISESHELL-AND-WHITE.\n\nIf tortoiseshell-and-white are desired, then a black-and-white male may\nbe", " selected, being bred in the same way as those recommended for the\npure tortoiseshell, or one withou", "t white if the female has white; but on\n_no account_ should an ordinary tabby be tolerated, but a re", "d tabby\nfemale of deep colour, or having white, may be held in request, though\nI would prefer patche", "s of colour not in any way barred. The gray tabby\nwill throw barred, spotted, or banded kittens, mix", "ed with tortoiseshell,\nwhich is the very worst form of mottling, and is very difficult to\neradicate.", " A gray \"ticking\" will most likely appear between the dark\ncolour, as it does between the black bars", " of the tabby.\n\n\nBLACK.\n\nThe best black, undoubtedly, are those bred from tortoiseshell mothers\nor f", "emales. The black is generally more dense, and less liable to show\nany signs of spots, bands, or bar", "s, when the animal is in the sun or a\nbright light; when this is so, it is fatal to a black as regar", "ds its\nchance of a prize, or even notice, and it comes under the denomination\nof a black tabby.\n\nIf ", "a black and a white cat are mated, let the black be the male, blacks\nhaving more stamina, the issue ", "will probably be either white or black;\nand also when you wish the black to be perpetuated, the blac", "k male must\nbe younger. In 1884, a black female cat was exhibited with five white\nkittens. I have ju", "st seen a beautiful black Persian whose mother was a\nclear white; this, and the foregoing example, p", "rove either colour\nrepresents the same for the purpose of breeding to colour.\n\nFor breeding black wi", "th white, take care that the white is the\ngray-white, and not the yellow-white; the first generally ", "has orange or\nyellow eyes, and this is one of the required qualities in the black cat.\nIf a yellow-w", "hite with blue eyes, this type of eye would be detrimental,\nand most likely the eyes of the offsprin", "g would have a green stain, or\npossibly be of odd colours.\n\nIt should be borne in mind, that black k", "ittens are seldom or ever so\nrich in colour when newly born, as they afterwards become; therefore, i", "f\nwithout spots or bars, and of a deep self brown-black, they will in all\npossibility be fine in col", "our when they gain their adult coat. This the\nexperienced fancier well knows, though the tyro often ", "destroys that\nwhich will ultimately prove of value, simply from ignorance. An instance\nof the brown-", "black kitten is before me as I write, in a beautiful\nPersian, which is now changing from the dull ki", "tten self brown-black on\nto a brilliant glossy, jetty beauty.\n\n\nBLUES.\n\nBlue in cats is one of the m", "ost extraordinary colours of any, for the\nreason that it is the _mixture_ of black which is no colou", "r, and white\nwhich is no colour, and this is the more curious because black mated\nwith white general", "ly produces either one colour or the other, or breaks\nblack and white, or white and black. The blue ", "being, as it were, a\nweakened black, or a withdrawal by white of some, if not all, of the\nbrown or r", "ed, varying in tint according to the colour of the black from\nwhich it was bred, dark-gray, or from ", "weakness in the stamina of the\nlitter. In the human species an alliance of the Negro, or African rac", "e,\nand the European, produces the mulatto, and some other shades of\ncoloured skin, though the hair g", "enerally retains the black hue; but\nseldom or ever are the colours broken up as in animal life, the ", "only\ninstance that has come to my knowledge, and I believe on record, being\nthat of the spotted Negr", "o boy, exhibited at fairs in England by\nRichardson, the famous showman; but in this case both the pa", "rents were\nblack, and natives of South Africa. The boy arrived in England in\nSeptember, 1809, and di", "ed February, 1813. His skin and hair were\neverywhere parti-coloured, transparent brown and white; on", " the crown of\nhis head several triangles, one within the other, were formed by\nalternations of the c", "olour of the hair.\n\nIn other domestic animals blue colour is not uncommon. Blue-tinted dogs,\nrabbits", ", horses of a blue-gray, or spotted with blue on a pink flesh\ncolour, as in the naked horse shown at", " the Crystal Palace some years\nago, also pigs; and all these have likewise broken colours of blue, o", "r\nblack, and white. I do not remember having seen any blue cattle, nor any\nblue guinea-pigs, but no ", "doubt these latter will soon exist. When once\nthe colour or break from the black is acquired, it is ", "then easy to go on\nmultiplying the different shades and varieties of tint and tone, from\nthe dark bl", "ue-black to the very light, almost white-gray. In some places\nin Russia, I am told, blue cats are ex", "ceedingly common; I have seen\nseveral shown under the names of Archangel, and others as Chartreuse a", "nd\nMaltese cats. Persians are imported sometimes of this colour, both dark\nand light. Next kin to it", " is the very light-gray tabby, with almost the\nsame hue, if not quite so light-gray markings. Two su", "ch mated have been\nknown to produce very light self grays, and of a lovely hue, a sort of\n\"morning g", "ray\"; these matched with black should breed blues. Old male\nblack, and young female white cats, have", " been known to produce kittens\nthis colour. There is a colony of farm cats at Rodmell, Sussex, from\n", "which very fine blues are bred. Light silver tabby males, and white\nfemales, are also apt to have on", "e or so in a litter of kittens; but\nthese generally are not such good blues, the colour being a gray", "-white,\nor nearly so, should the hair or coat be parted or divided, the skin\nbeing light. The very d", "ark, if from brown-black, are not so blue, but\ncome under the denomination of \"smokies,\" or blue \"sm", "okies,\" with\nscarcely a tint of blue in them; some \"smokies\" are white, or nearly so,\nwith dark tips", " to the hair; these more often occur among Persian than\nEnglish cats, though I once had a smoky tabb", "y bred from a black and a\nsilver tabby. Importations of some of the former are often extremely\nlight", ", scarcely showing any markings. These, and such as these, are very\nvaluable where a self blue is de", "sired. If these light colours are\nfemales, a smoke-coloured male is an excellent cross, as it alread", "y\nshows a weakened colour. For a very light, tender, delicate, light-gray\nlong-haired self, I should", " try a white male, and either a rich blue, or\na soft gray, extremely lightly-marked tabby.\n\nAs a rul", "e, all broken whites, such as black and white, should be\navoided; because, as I explained at the com", "mencement of these notes on\nblues, the blue is black and white _amalgamated_, or the brown withdrawn", "\nfrom the colouring, or, if not, with the colours breaking, or becoming\nblack and white. If whole co", "loured blues are in request, then\nparti-colours, such as white and black, or black and white, are be", "st\nexcluded. Blue and white are easily attainable by mating a blue male\nwith a white and black femal", "e.\n\nThe best and deepest coloured of the blue short-haired cats are from\nArchangel. Those I have see", "n were very fine in colour, the pelage being\nthe same colour to the skin, which was also dark and of", " a uniform\nlilac-tinted blue. Some come by chance. I knew of a blue English cat,\nwinner of several p", "rizes, whose parents were a black and white male\nmated with a \"light-gray tabby\" and white; but this", " was an exception to\nthe rule, for strongly-marked tabbies are not a good cross.\n\n\nBROWN TABBY.\n\nFor", " the purpose of breeding rich brown black-striped tabbies, a male of\na rich dark rufous or red tabby", " should be selected, the bands being\nregular and not too broad, the lighter or ground colour showing", " well\nbetween the lines; if the black lines are very broad, it is then a\nblack, striped with brown, ", "instead of a brown with black, which is\nwrong. With this match a female of a good brown ground colou", "r, marked\nwith dense, not broad, black bands, having clear, sharply defined edges.\nNote also that th", "e centre line of the back is a distinct line, with the\nbrown ground colour on which it is placed bei", "ng in no way interspersed\nwith black, and at least as broad as the black line; by this cross\nfinely-", "marked kittens of a brilliant colour may be expected. But if the\nprogeny are not so bright as requir", "ed, and the ground colour not glowing\nenough, then, when the young arrive at maturity, mate with a d", "ark-yellow\nred tabby either male or female.\n\nVery beautiful brown tabbies are also to be found among", " the litters of\nthe female tortoiseshell, allied with a dark-brown tabby with narrow\nblack bars. It ", "is a cross that may be tried with advantage for both\nvariety and richness of colour, among which it ", "will not be found\ndifficult to find something worthy of notice.\n\n\nWHITE.\n\nOf English, or short-haire", "d cats, the best white are those from a\ntortoiseshell mother, and as often some of the best blacks. ", "These whites\nare generally of soft yellow, or sandy tint of white. Although they have\npink noses, as", " also are the cushions of their feet, they are not\nAlbinos, not having the peculiar pink or red eyes", ", nor are they\ndeficient in sight. I have seen and examined with much care some\nhundreds of white ca", "ts, but have never yet seen one with pink eyes,\nthough it has been asserted that such exist, and the", "re is no reason why\nthey should not. Still, I am inclined to think they do not, and the pale\nblue ey", "es, or the red tinted blue, like those of the Siamese, take the\nplace of it in the feline race; neit", "her have I ever seen a white horse\nwith pink eyes, but I find it mentioned in one of the daily paper", "s that\namong other presents to the Emperor of Russia, the Bokhara Embassy took\nwith them ten thoroug", "hbred saddle-horses of different breeds, one of\nthem being a magnificent animal--a pure white stalli", "on with _blue eyes_.\n\nThe cold gray-white is the opposite of the black, and this knowledge\nshould no", "t be lost sight of in mating. It generally has yellow or light\norange eyes. This colour, in a male, ", "may be crossed with the\nyellow-white with advantage, when more strength of constitution is\nrequired;", " but otherwise I deem the best matching is that of two\nyellow-white, both with blue eyes, for soft h", "air, elegance, and beauty;\nbut even a black male and a white female produce whites, and sometimes\nbl", "acks, but the former are generally of a coarse description, and harsh\nin coat by comparison. I think", " the blue-eyed white are a distinct breed\nfrom the common ordinary white cat, nor do I remember any ", "such being\nbred from those with eyes of yellow colour.\n\n\nABYSSINIAN.\n\nTo breed these true, it is wel", "l to procure imported or pedigree stock,\nfor many cats are bred in England from ordinary tabbies, th", "at so nearly\nresemble Abyssinian in colour as scarcely to be distinguished from the\nmuch-prized fore", "igners. The males are generally of a darker colour than\nthe females, and are mostly marked with dark", "-brown bands on the\nforehead, a black band along the back which ends at the tip of the tail,\nwith wh", "ich it is annulated. The ticking should be of the truest kind,\neach hair being of three distinct col", "ours, blue, yellow, or red, and\nblack at the points, the cushions of the feet black, and back of the", "\nhind-legs. Choose a female, with either more red or yellow, the markings\nbeing the same, and, with ", "care in the selection, there will be some very\nbrilliant specimens. Eyes bright orange-yellow.\n\n\nABY", "SSINIAN CROSSES.\n\nCuriously coloured as the Abyssinian cat is, and being a true breed, no\ndoubt of l", "ong far back ancestry, it is most useful in crossing with\nother varieties, even with the Persian, Ru", "ssian, Angora, or the\nArchangel, the ticking hues being easy of transmission, and is then\ncapable of", " charming and delightful tints, with breadths of beautiful\nmottled or grizzled colouring, if judicio", "usly mated. The light tabby\nPersian, matched with a female Abyssinian, would give unexpected\nsurpris", "es, so with the dark blue Archangel; a well-ticked blue would not\nonly be a novelty, but an elegant ", "colour hitherto unseen.

In any other colour classes, the beauties,", "\nwhatever they may be, are chiefly the result of accident or sports,\nselected for such beauty, or in", " other ways equally interesting.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nCAT AND KITTENS.\n\n\nCare and at", "tention is necessary when the cat is likely to become a\nmother. A basket or box, half filled with sw", "eet hay, or clean oat straw,\nwith some flannel in the winter, is absolutely requisite, and a quiet\nn", "ook or corner selected away from light, noise, and intrusion. Some\nprefer a box made like a rabbit-h", "utch, with sleeping place, and a barred\ndoor to one or both compartments which may be closed when th", "ought\nnecessary for comfort and quiet. The cat should be placed within, with\nfood and new milk by or", " inside, and there be regularly fed for a few\ndays, all pans and plates to be kept well washed, and ", "only as much food\ngiven at a time as can be eaten at one meal, so that everything is clean\nand fresh", ". Cats, as I have before stated, delight in cleanliness,\ntherefore this, nor any comfort, should not", " be forgotten or omitted, for\nso much depends on her health and the growth of her little family, wit", "h\nregard to their future well-being.\n\nThe cat brings forth three times a year, and often more. The t", "ime of\ngestation is to sixty-three days, and the number of the kittens varies\nmuch. Some will have f", "ive to six at a birth, while others _never_ have\nmore than two or three. I had a blue tabby, \"The Ol", "d Lady,\" which never\nhad more than _one_. The cat, however, is a very prolific animal, and,\nif of lo", "ng life, produces a very numerous progeny. _The Derby Gazette_,\nDecember 10th, 1886, states:--\"There", " is a cat at Cromford, the age of\nwhich is nineteen years. It belonged to the late Mr. Isaac Orme, w", "ho\ndied a few months ago. The old man made an entry of all the kittens the\ncat had given birth to, w", "hich, up to the time of his death, numbered\n120. It has now just given birth to _one_ more. It will ", "not leave the\nhouse where the old man died, except to visit a neighbouring house,\nwhere there is a h", "armonium; and when the instrument is being played, the\ncat will go and stand on its hind-legs beside", " the player.\"\n\nCats live to various ages, the oldest I have seen being twenty-one\nyears, and the for", "egoing is the greatest age at which I have known one\nto breed. But I am indebted to Mrs. Paterson, o", "f Tunbridge Wells, for\nthe information that Mr. Sandal had a cat that lived to the\nextraordinary age", " of twenty-four years. I have seen Mr. Sandal, and\nfound that such was the case. It was a short-hair", "ed cat, and rather\nabove the usual size, and tabby in colour.\n\nWhen littered, the kittens are weak, ", "blind, deaf, helpless little\nthings, and it appears almost impossible they can ever attain the suppl", "e\ngrace and elegance of form and motion so much admired in the\nfully-developed cat.\n\nThe state of vi", "sual darkness continues until the eighth or ninth day,\nduring which the eyesight is gradually develo", "ping. After this they grow\nrapidly, and, at the age of a few weeks, the gamboling, frolicsome life\no", "f \"kittenhood\" begins, and they begin to feed, lap milk, if slightly\nwarm, when placed in front of t", "hem.\n\nNo animal is more fond and attentive than the cat; she is the most\ntender and gentle of nurses", ", watching closely every movement of her\nyoung. With the utmost solicitude she brings the choicest m", "orsels of her\nown food, which she lays before them, softly purring, while with gentle\nand motherly w", "ays she attracts them to the spot while she sits or\nstands, looking on with evident satisfaction, fu", "ll of almost\nuncontrollable pleasure and delight, at their eager, but often futile\nattempts and ende", "avours to eat and enjoy the dainty morsel. Yet nothing\nis wasted, for after waiting what appears to ", "her a reasonable time, and\ngiving them every encouragement, and with the most exemplary patience,\nsh", "e teaches them what they should do, and how, by slowly making a meal\nof the residue herself, frequen", "tly stopping and fondling and licking\nthem in the hope they will yet make another effort. What can b", "e more\nsensitively touching than the following anecdote, sent to _The Animal\nWorld_ by C. E. N., in ", "1876? It is a little poem of everyday life, full\nof deep feeling and feline love.\n\n\"I have a small t", "abby cat, very comely and graceful. Being very fond of\nher kitten, she is always uneasy if she loses", " sight of it if only for a\nshort time. For the last six weeks, the mother, failing to recall the\ntru", "ant back by her voice, even returns to the kitchen for the lower\nportion of a rabbit's fore-leg, whi", "ch has served as a plaything for some\ntime. With this in her mouth, she proceeds to search for her l", "ost one,\ncrying all the time, and, putting it down at her feet, repeats her\nentreaties, to which the", " kitten, allured by the sight of its plaything,\ngenerally responds. Owing to its gambols in the open", " air during the\ninclement weather, the kitten was seized with an affliction of the\nthroat; the mothe", "r, puzzled with the prostration of its offspring,\nbrought down the rabbit's foot to attract attentio", "n. In vain; the kitten\ndied. Even now the loving mother searches for the rabbit's foot, and\nbrings i", "t down.\"\n\nAn instance of the peculiar foresight and instinct, so often observable\nin the cat, is rel", "ated in _The Animal World_, October, 1882. Miss M.\nwrites: \"This house is very old, and big impudent", " rats often appear in\nthe shop, so a cat is always kept on the premises. Pussy is about five\nyears o", "ld, and is a handsome, light tortoiseshell, with a pretty face\nand coaxing ways. A month ago she had", " three kittens, one of which was\nkept; they were born in the drawing-room, by the side of the piano.", " When\nthe two were taken away, pussy carried the one remaining to the\nfireplace, and made it a bed u", "nder the grate with shavings. When a\nfortnight old, both were removed downstairs to the room behind ", "the shop.\nOne day last week an enormous rat appeared; pussy spied him, and set up\nher back; but her ", "motherly instinct prevailed. She looked round the\nshop, and, finding a drawer high up a little way o", "pen, she jumped with\nher kitten in her mouth, and dropped it into the drawer, after which she\ndescen", "ded and fought a battle royal with the rat, which she soon\ndespatched and carried to her mistress, t", "hen went back to the drawer and\nbrought out her kitten.\"\n\nHere is another fact as regards the observ", "ation of cats, which possibly,\nin this respect, is not far different from some other domestic animal", "s.\n\"A gray and white cat, 'Jenny' (a house cat), had three kittens in the\nhollow stump of an old ash", "-tree, some distance from the house. There,\nfrom time to time, she took them food, and there nursed ", "them. One day,\nlooking from the window, I observed a very heavy storm was approaching,\nand also, wha", "t should I see but Mistress 'Jenny' running across the\nmeadow as fast as she could, and, on her draw", "ing nearer, I noticed that\nshe had one of her kittens in her mouth. She ran past and put the kitten\n", "into a small outhouse, when she immediately hastened back, and returned\nbringing another of her kitt", "ens, which she put in the same place. Again\nshe started for the wood, and shortly reappeared bringin", "g her third and\nlast kitten, though more slowly, seemingly very tired. I was just\nthinking of going ", "to help her, when she suddenly quickened her pace and\nran for the outhouse; just then a few drops of", " rain began to fall. In a\nfew moments a deluge of water was falling, the lightning was flashing,\nthe", " thunder crashed overhead and rumbled in the distance, but 'Jenny'\ndid not mind, for she had her thr", "ee kittens comfortably housed, and she\nand they were all nestled together in an apple basket, warm a", "nd dry.\nSurely she must have known, by instinct or observation, that the storm\nwas coming.\"--From my", " Book of \"_Animal Stories, Old and New_.\"\n\nShould it be deemed necessary to destroy some, if not all", " of the litter,\nwhich, unfortunately, is sometimes the case, it is not well to take away\nthe whole a", "t once; but it is advisable to let a day or two intervene\nbetween each removal; the mother will thus", " be relieved of much\nsuffering, especially if one at least is left for her to rear, but two\nis prefe", "rable. Still, when the progeny are well-marked or otherwise\nvaluable, and large specimens are requir", "ed for show or other purposes,\nthree kittens are enough to leave, though some advocate as many as fi", "ve;\nbut if this is done it is better to provide a foster-mother for two, for\nwhich even a dog will o", "ften prove a very good substitute for one of the\nfeline race. In either case, slightly warm new milk", " should be given at\nleast three times a day; the milk should not be heated, but some hot\nwater put t", "o it, and as soon as their teeth are sufficiently grown for\nthem to be of use in mastication give so", "me raw beef cut very small and\nfine. Some prefer chopped liver; I do not; but never give more than t", "hey\ncan lap or eat at each meal. This liberal treatment will make a\nwonderful difference in their gr", "owth, and also their general health and\nstrength; and being so fed makes them more docile. And it sh", "ould be\nborne in mind that in a state of nature cats always bring raw food to\ntheir young as soon as", " they are able to eat; therefore raw meat is far\nthe best to give them--their dentition proves this.", "\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nKITTENS.\n\n\nKittenhood, the baby time especially of country cats, is with most t", "he\nbrightest, sprightliest, and prettiest period of their existence, and\nperhaps the most happy. Tru", "e, when first born and in the earliest era of\ntheir lives, they are blind, helpless little things, d", "ull, weak, and\nstaggering, scarcely able to stand, if at all, almost rolling over at\nevery attempt, ", "making querulous, fretful noises, if wakeful or cold, or\nfor the time motherless. But 'tis not for l", "ong; awhile, and she, the\nfondest of mothers, is with them. They are nestled about her, or amid\nher ", "soft, warm fluffy fur, cossetted with parental tenderness, caressed,\nnurtured, and, with low, sweet ", "tones and fondlings, they are soothed\nagain and again to sleep.--They sleep.--Noiseless, and with ma", "ny a\nlonging, lingering look, the careful, watchful, loving creature slowly\nand reluctantly steals a", "way; soon to return, when she and her little\nones are lost \"in the land of dreams.\" And so from day ", "to day, until\nbright, meek-eyed, innocent, inquiring little faces, with eager eyes,\npeep above the b", "asket that is yet their home.

When shown as ", "kittens under six months old, and they\nhave changed the _whole_ of their kittenhood teeth for those ", "of the\nadult, it is generally considered a fairly _strong_ proof that their\nlife is in excess of tha", "t age, and the judge is therefore certainly\njustified in disqualifying such exhibit, though sometime", "s, as in other\ndomestic animals, there occurs premature change, as well as inexplicable\ndelay.\n\nKitt", "ens are not so cleanly in their habits as cats of a mature growth;\nthis is more generally the case w", "hen they have been _separated from the\nmother-cat_, or when removed to some place that is strange to", " them, or\nwhen sufficient care is not taken, by letting them out of the house\noccasionally. When the", "y cannot from various reasons be so turned out, a\nbox should be provided, partly filled with dry ear", "th, to which they may\nretire. This is always a requisite when cats or kittens are valuable,\nand ther", "efore obliged to be kept within doors, especially in\nneighbourhoods where there is a chance of their", " being lost or stolen.\n\nIt should also be borne in mind, that the present and future health of\nan an", "imal, be it what it may, is subject to many incidences, and not the\nleast of these is good and appro", "priate food, shelter, warmth, and\ncleanliness. It is best to feed at regular intervals. In confineme", "nt,\nMr. Bartlett, the skilful and experienced manager of the Zoological\nSociety's Gardens, at Regent", "'s Park, finds that one meal a day is\nsufficient, and this is thought also to be the case with a ful", "l-grown\ncat, more especially when it has the opportunity of ranging and getting\nother food, such as ", "mice, and \"such small deer;\" but with \"young things\"\nit is different, as it is deemed necessary to g", "et as much strength and\ngrowth as possible. I therefore advocate several meals a day, at least\nthree", ", with a variety of food, such as raw shin of beef, cut very small;\nbones to pick; fish of sorts, wi", "th all the bones taken out, or refuse\nparts; milk, with a little hot water; boiled rice or oatmeal, ", "with milk\nor without it; and grass, if possible; if not, some boiled vegetables,\nstalks of asparagus", ", cabbage, or even carrots. Let the food be varied\nfrom time to time, but never omitting the finely-", "cut raw beef every day.\nI am not in favour of liver, or \"lights,\" as it is called, either for\ncats o", "r kittens. If horseflesh can be depended on, it is a very\nfavourite and strengthening food, and may ", "be given. The kitten should be\nkept warm and dry, and away from draughts.\n\nAlso take especial care n", "ot in any way to frighten, tease, or worry a\nyoung animal, but do everything possible to give confid", "ence and engender\nregard, fondness, or affection for its owner; always be gentle and yet\nfirm in its", " training. Do not allow it to do one day uncorrected, that\nfor which it is punished the next for the", " same kind of fault. If it is\ndoing wrong remove it, speaking gently, _at the time_, and not _wait\nl", "ong after the fault is committed_, or they will not know what the\npunishment is for. Many animals' t", "empers are spoiled entirely by this\nmode of proceeding.\n\nTake care there is always a clean vessel, w", "ith pure clear water for them\nto drink when thirsty.\n\n[Illustration: MISS MOORE'S KITTEN, \"CHLOE.\"]\n", "\n\n\n\nMANAGEMENT OF KITTENS AND CATS.\n\nThese require quiet and kindly treatment. Do nothing quickly or", "\nsuddenly, so as in any way to scare or frighten, but when speaking to\nthem, let the voice be modera", "ted, gentle, and soft in tone. Cats are not\nslow to understand kind treatment, and may often be seen", " to watch the\ncountenance as though trying to fathom our thoughts. Some cats are of a\nvery timorous ", "nature, and are thus easily dismayed. Others again are\nmore bold in their ways and habits, and are e", "ver ready for cossetty\nattention; but treat both as you would be treated--kindly.\n\nAs to food, as al", "ready noted, I have found raw beef the best, with milk\nmixed with a little hot water to drink--never", " boil it--and give plenty\nof grass, or some boiled vegetable, such as asparagus, sea-kale, or\ncelery", "; they also are fond of certain weeds, such as cat-mint, and\nequisetum, or mares' or cats' tails, as", " it is sometimes called. If fish\nis given it is best mixed with either rice or oatmeal, and boiled,\n", "otherwise it is apt to produce diarrhoea.\n\nHorse-flesh may be given as a change, provided that it is", " not from a\ndiseased animal; and should be boiled, and be fresh.\n\nBrown bread and milk is also good ", "and healthy food; the bread should be\ncut in cubes of half an inch, and the warm milk and water pour", "ed on;\nonly enough for one meal should be prepared at a time.\n\nLet the cat and kittens have as much ", "fresh air as is possible; and if\nfed on some dainty last thing at night they will be sure to \"come i", "n,\"\nand thus preserved from doing and receiving injury.\n\nIf cats are in any way soiled in their coat", ", especially the long-haired\nvarieties, and cannot cleanse themselves, they may be washed in warm,\ns", "oapy water; but this is not advisable in kittens, unless great care is\nused to prevent their taking ", "cold.\n\nSome cats like being brushed, and it is often an improvement to the\npelage or fur if carefull", "y done; but in all cases the brush should have\nsoft, close hair, which should be rather long than ot", "herwise.\n\nDo not let your cats or kittens wear collars or ribbons always,\nespecially if they are ram", "blers, for the reason that they are liable to\nget caught on spikes of railings or twigs of bushes, a", "nd so starved to\ndeath, or strangled, unless discovered.\n\nFor sending cats to an exhibition, a close", "-made basket is best, which\nwill allow for ventilation, as fresh air is most essential; and have it\n", "sufficiently large to allow of the cat standing and turning about,\nespecially if a long journey is b", "efore them. I have _seen_ cats sent to\nshows taken out of _small boxes_, _dead_, stifled to death--\"", "poor\nthings.\"\n\nBear in mind that the higher and better condition your cat is in on its\narrival at th", "e show, the greater is the chance of winning.\n\nDo not put carpet or woollen fabrics in the basket, b", "ut plenty of good,\nsweet hay or oat-straw; this will answer all purposes, and does not get\nsodden.\n\n", "If you use a padlock for the fastening, _do not forget to send the key\nto the manager of the show_, ", "as is sometimes the case.\n\n[Illustration: CAT CLUB CHALLENGE CUP.]\n\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nPOINTS BY WH", "ICH CATS ARE JUDGED,\n\nAS SPECIFIED BY MYSELF.\n\n              _Revised and corrected to the present t", "ime._\n\n                           ...

T", "hrough the kindness of friends I am enabled to\ngive recipes for medicines considered as useful, or, ", "at any rate,\ntending to abate the severity of the attack in the one, and utterly\neradicate the other", ". Care should always be taken on the first symptoms\nof illness to remove the animal at once from con", "tact with others. My\nkind friend, Dr. George Fleming, C.B., principal veterinary surgeon of\nthe army", ", has courteously sent me a copy of a remedy for cat distemper\nfrom his very excellent work, \"Animal", " Plagues: their History, Nature,\nand Prevention,\" which I give in full.\n\n\nCATARRHAL FEVERS.\n\n\"Cats a", "re, like some other of the domesticated animals, liable to be\nattacked by two kinds of Catarrhal Fev", "er, one of which is undoubtedly\nvery infectious--like distemper in dogs--and the other may be looked", "\nupon as the result of a simple cold, and therefore not transmissible.\nThe first is, of course, the ", "most severe and fatal, and often prevails\nmost extensively, affecting cats generally over wide areas", ", sometimes\nentire continents being invaded by it. From A.D. 1414 up to 1832 no\nfewer than nineteen ", "widespread outbreaks of this kind have been\nrecorded. The most notable of these was in 1796, when th", "e cats in\nEngland and Holland were generally attacked by the disease, and in the\nfollowing year when", " it had spread over Europe and extended to America;\nin 1803, it again appeared in this country and o", "ver a large part of the\nEuropean continent.\n\n\"The symptoms are intense fever, prostration, vomiting,", " diarrhoea,\nsneezing, cough, and profuse discharge from the nose and eyes. Sometimes\nthe parotid gla", "nds are swollen, as in human mumps. Dr. Darwin, of Derby,\nuncle to Charles Darwin, thought it was a ", "kind of mumps, and therefore\ndesignated it _Parotitis felina_.\n\n\"The treatment consists in careful n", "ursing and cleanliness, keeping the\nanimal moderately warm and comfortable. The disease rapidly prod", "uces\nintense debility, and therefore the strength should be maintained from\nthe very commencement by", " frequent small doses of strong beef-tea, into\nwhich one grain of quinine has been introduced twice ", "a day, a small\nquantity of port wine (from half to one teaspoonful) according to the\nsize of the cat", ", and the state of debility. If there is no diarrhoea,\nbut constipation, a small dose of castor oil ", "or syrup of buckthorn\nshould be given. Solid food should not be allowed until convalescence\nhas set ", "in. Isolation, with regard to other cats, and disinfection,\nshould be attended to.\n\n\"Simple Catarrh ", "demands similar treatment. Warmth, cleanliness, broth,\nand beef-tea, are the chief items of treatmen", "t, with a dose of castor\noil if constipation is present. If the discharge obstructs the nostrils\nit ", "should be removed with a sponge, and these and the eyes may be bathed\nwith a weak lotion of vinegar ", "and water.\"\n\n\"As regards inoculation for distemper,\" Dr. Fleming says, \"it has been\ntried, but the r", "emedy is often worse than the disease, at least as bad\nas the natural disease. _Vaccination_ has als", "o been tried, but it is\n_valueless_. Probably inoculation with cultivated or modified virus\nwould be", " found a good and safe preventative.\"\n\nI was anxious to know about this, as inoculation used to be t", "he practice\nwith packs of hounds.\n\nIt will be observed that Dr. Fleming treats the distemper as a ki", "nd of\ninfluenza, and considers one of the most important things is to keep up\nthe strength of the su", "ffering animal. Other members of the R.C.V.S.,\nwhom I have consulted, have all given the same kind o", "f advice, not only\nprescribing for the sick animal wine, but brandy, as a last resource, to\narouse s", "inking vitality. Mr. George Cheverton, of High Street, Tunbridge\nWells, who is very successful with ", "animals and their diseases, thinks it\nbest to treat them homoeopathically. The following is what he\n", "prescribes as efficacious for some of the most dire complaints with\nwhich cats are apt to be afflict", "ed.\n\n\nWORMS.\n\nFor a full-grown cat give 3 grains of santonine every night for a week\nor 10 days; it ", "might be administered in milk, or given in a small piece\nof beef or meat of any kind.

The drawing I give abo", "ve was made from one sent to the first\nCrystal Palace Cat Show in 1871, by the Duke of Sutherland, f", "rom\nSutherlandshire. It was caught in a trap by the fore-leg, which was much\ninjured, but not so as ", "to prevent its moving with great alacrity, even\nwith agility, endeavouring frequently to use the cla", "ws of both fore-feet\nwith a desperate determination and amazing vigour. It was a very\npowerful anima", "l, possessing great strength, taking size into\nconsideration, and of extraordinary fierceness.\n\nMr. ", "Wilson, the manager of the show, though an excellent naturalist,\ntried to get it out of the thick-ba", "rred, heavy-made travelling box in\nwhich it arrived, into one of the ordinary wire show-cages, think", "ing it\nwould appear to better advantage; but in this endeavour he was\nunsuccessful, the animal resis", "ting all attempts to expel it from the one\ninto the other, making such frantic and determined opposi", "tion that the\nidea was abandoned. This was most fortunate, for the wire cages then in\nuse were after", "wards found unequal to confining even the ordinary\ndomestic cat, which, in more than one instance, f", "orced the bars apart\nsufficiently to allow of escape. As it was, the wild cat maintained its\npositio", "n, sullenly retiring to one corner of the box, where it scowled,\ngrowled, and fought in a most fearf", "ul and courageous manner during the\ntime of its exhibition, never once relaxing its savage watchfuln", "ess or\nattempts to injure even those who fed it. I never saw anything more\nunremittingly ferocious, ", "nor apparently more untamable.\n\nIt was a grand animal, however, and most interesting to the naturali", "st,\nbeing, even then, scarcely ever seen; if so, only in districts far away\nand remote from the dwel", "lings of civilisation. Yet I believe I saw one\namong the rocks of Bodsbeck, in Dumfriesshire, many y", "ears ago, though of\nthis I am not certain, as it was too far away for accurate observation\nbefore it", " turned and stood at bay, and on my advancing it disappeared.\nThe animal shown at the Crystal Palace", " was very much lighter in colour,\nand with less markings than those in the British Museum, the tail\n", "shorter, and the dark rings fewer, the lines on the body not much deeper\nin tint than the ground col", "our, excepting on the forehead and the inside\nof the fore-legs, which were darker, rather a light re", "d round the mouth,\nand almost white on the chest--which appears to be usual with the wild\ncat; the e", "yes were yellow-tinted green, the tips of the ears, the lips,\ncushions of the feet, and a portion of", " the back part of the hind-legs,\nblack; the markings were, in short, irregular thin lines, and in no", " way\nresembled those of the ordinary black-marked domestic tabby cat,\npossessing little elegance of ", "line--in character it was bolder, having\na rugged sturdiness, being stronger and broader built, the ", "fore-arms\nthick, massive, and endowed with great power, with long, curved claws,\nthe feet were stout", ", sinewy, and strong; altogether it was a very\npeculiar, interesting, and extraordinary animal. What", " became of it I\nnever learned.\n\nIn 1871 and 1872, a wild cat was exhibited at the Crystal Palace Cat", "\nShow, by the Earl of Hopetoun, aged three years, also some hybrid\nkittens, the father of which was ", "a long-haired cat, the mother a sandy,\nby a wild cat out of a long-haired tabby, which proves, if pr", "oof were\nwanting, that such hybrids breed freely either with hybrids, the\ndomestic, or the wild cat.", "\n\nMr. Frank Buckland also exhibited a hybrid between the wild and tame\ncat.\n\nThe Zoological Society,", " a pair of wild cats which did not appear to be\nBritish.\n\nIn 1873, Mr. A. H. Senger sent a fine spec", "imen of hybrid, between the\ndomestic cat and Scotch wild cat.\n\nAn early description of the wild cat ", "in England is to be found in an old\nbook on Natural History, and copied into a work on \"Menageries,\"", "\n\"Bartholomoeus de Proprietatibus Rerum,\" which was translated into\nEnglish by Thomas Berthlet, and ", "printed by Wynkyn de Worde as early as\n1498. There is a very interesting description of the cat, whi", "ch gives\nnearly all the properties of the wild animal in an odd and very amusing\nway. It states: \"He", " is most like to the leopard, and hath a great\nmouthe, and saw teeth and sharp, and long tongue, and", " pliant, thin, and\nsubtle; and lappeth therewith when he drinketh, as other beasts do, that\nhave the", " nether lip shorter than the over; for, by cause of unevenness\nof lips, such beasts suck not in drin", "king, but lap and lick, as\nAristotle saith and Plinius also. And he is a full lecherous beast in\nyou", "th, swift, pliant, and merry, and leapeth, and riseth on all things\nthat is tofore him; and is led b", "y a straw, and playeth therewith, and is\na right heavy beast in age, and full sleepy, and lieth slyl", "y in wait for\nmice; and is ware where they bene more by smell than by sight, and\nhunteth and riseth ", "on them in privy places; and when he taketh a mouse,\nhe playeth therewith, and eateth him after the ", "play; and is a cruel\nbeast when he is wild, and dwelleth in woods, and hunteth there small\nwild beas", "ts as conies and hares.\"\n\nThe next appears in John Bossewell's \"Workes of Armorie,\" folio, A.D.\n1597", ":\n\n     \"This beaste is called a Musion, for that he is enimie to Myse\n     and Rattes.

Yet even thi", "s old chronicler\n     mentions the fact of his being \"wilde,\" clearly indicating a\n     similar anim", "al in a state of domestication. Later on we find\n     Maister Salmon giving an account of the cat in", " his\n     strangely-curious book, \"Salmon's Compleat English Physician; or,\n     the Druggist's Shop", " Opened,\" A.D. 1693, in which he relates that\n     marvellous properties exist in the brain, bones, ", "etc., of the\n     cat, giving recipes mostly cruel and incredible. He describes\n     \"Catus the Cat\"", " in such terms as these:\n\n     \"_The Cat of Mountain_, all which are of one nature, and agree\n     m", "uch in one shape, save as to their magnitude, the _wild Cat_\n     being larger than the _Tame_ and t", "he _Cat of Mountain_ much\n     larger than the _wild Cat_.

It is true\n     that occasionally", " varieties of the _Felin\u00e6_ do breed in our\n     caravans and menageries, where artificial warmth is ", "kept up to\n     represent something like a tropical temperature; but the\n     circumstance is too ra", "re to ground any opinion on of their ever\n     having been indigenous here--at least, since our part", " of the\n     globe has cooled down to its present temperature. It is,\n     therefore, more than prob", "able that both the wild and the tame cat\n     have been derived from some other extra-European sourc", "e or\n     sources. We say source or sources, for such admission begets\n     another difficulty not e", "asily got over, which is this, that if\n     both of these grimalkins own one common root, in which v", "ariety\n     was it that the very marked differences between them have taken\n     place? Most sportsm", "en, we believe, suspect that they own one\n     common origin, and some naturalists also do the same,", " contending\n     that the differences observable between them are attributable\n     solely to the lo", "ng-continued action of external agencies, which\n     had modified the various organs to meet the var", "ied necessities of\n     the animals. The wild cat, according to this theory, having to\n     contend ", "with powerful enemies, expanded in general dimensions;\n     its limbs, particularly, became massive;", " and its long and strong\n     claws, with the powerful muscular mechanism which operated on\n     the", "m, fitted it for a life of predacity. Thus its increased size\n     enabled it to stand some time bef", "ore any other dogs than\n     high-bred foxhounds, and even before them also, in any place but\n     t", "he direct open ground. There exist, however, in direct\n     contradiction to this opinion, certain s", "pecialities proper to the\n     wild, and certain other to the domestic cat, besides the simple\n     ", "expansion of bulk, which sufficiently disprove their identity. It\n     will be seen that a remarkabl", "e difference exists between the\n     tails of the two animals; that of the domestic being, as is wel", "l\n     known, long, and tapering elegantly to a point, whereas that of\n     the wild cat is seen to ", "be broad, and to terminate abruptly in a\n     blunt or rounded extremity. Linn\u00e6us and Buffon having ", "both of\n     them confounded these two species into one, have contributed much\n     to propagate thi", "s error, which affords us another opportunity of\n     adding to the many we have taken of remarking ", "on the vast\n     importance of comparative anatomy, which enables us to draw just\n     distinctions ", "between animals that might otherwise erroneously be\n     adjudged to be dependent on external agenci", "es, etc. Nor need we\n     rest here, for what doubt can be entertained on the subject when\n     we p", "oint at the remarkable difference between the intestines of\n     the two? _Those of the domestic are", " nine times the length of its\n     body_, whereas, in the _wild cat_, they are little more than\n    ", " _three times as long as the body_.\"\n\nThe food of the wild cat is said to consist of animals, and in", " the\nopinion of some, fish should be added. Why not also birds' eggs? Cats\nare particularly fond of ", "the latter. In the event of their finding and\ndestroying a nest, they invariably eat the eggs, and g", "enerally the\nshells.\n\nMuch has been written as to the aptitude of the domestic cat at catching\nfish.", " If this be so, are fish necessarily a part of the food of the\nnative wild cat? Numerous instances a", "re adduced of our \"household cat\"\nplunging into water in pursuit of and capture of fish. Although I ", "have\nspent much time in watching cats that were roaming beside streams and\nabout ponds, there has ne", "ver been even an attempt at \"fishing.\" Frogs\nthey will take and kill, often greedily devouring the s", "mall ones. Yet\ndoubtless they will hunt, catch, and eat fish, for the fact has become\nproverbial.\n\n[", "Illustration: WILD CAT, BRITISH MUSEUM.]\n\nA writer in \"Menageries\" states: \"There is no doubt that w", "ild cats will\nseize on fish, and the passionate longing of the domestic cat after this\nfood is an ev", "idence of the natural desire. We have seen a cat overcome\nher natural reluctance to wet her feet, an", "d take an eel out of a pail of\nwater.\" Dr. Darwin alludes to this propensity: \"Mr. Leonard, a very\ni", "ntelligent friend of mine, saw a cat catch a trout by darting on it in\ndeep, clear water, at the Mil", "l, Wexford, near Lichfield. The cat\nbelonged to Mr. Stanley, who had often seen it catch fish.\"\n\nCas", "es have also been known of cats catching fish in shallow water,\nspringing on them from the banks of ", "streams and ponds; but I take this\nas not _the habit_ of the domestic cat, though it is not unusual.", "\n\nGray, in a poem, tells of a cat's death through drowning, while\nattempting to take gold-fish from ", "a vase filled with water.\n\nOf Dr. Samuel Johnson it is related, that his cat having fallen sick and\n", "refused all food, he became aware that cats are fond of fish. With this\nknowledge before him he went", " to the fishmonger's and bought an oyster\nfor the sick creature, wrapped it in paper and brought the", " appetising\nmorsel home. The cat relished the dainty food, and the Doctor was seen\ngoing on the same", " kindly errand every day until his suffering feline\nfriend was restored to health.\n\nStill this is no", " proof that the _wild_ cat, in a pure state of nature,\nfeeds on fish. Again, it is nothing unusual f", "or domestic cats to catch\nand eat cockroaches, crickets, cockchafers, also large and small moths,\nbu", "t not so all. In domesticity some are almost omnivorous. But is the\nwild cat? Taking its anatomical ", "structure into consideration, there is\ndoubtless a wide distinction, both as regards food and habit.", "\n\nIn Daniel's \"Rural Sports,\" A.D. 1813, the wild cat is stated to be \"now\nscarce in England, inhabi", "ting the mountainous and woody parts. Mr.\nPennant describes it as _four_ times the size of the house", " cat, but the\nhead larger, that it multiplies as fast, and may be called the British\n_tiger_, being ", "the fiercest and most destructive beast we have. When\nonly wounded with shot they will attack the pe", "rson who injured them, and\noften have strength enough to be no despicable enemy.\"\n\nThrough the kind ", "courtesy of that painstaking, excellent, observant, and\neminent naturalist, Mr. J. E. Harting, I am ", "enabled to reprint a portion\nof his lecture on the origin of the domestic cat, and which afterwards\n", "appeared in _The Field_. Although many of the statements are known to\nnaturalists, still I prefer gi", "ving them in the order in which they are\nso skilfully arranged, presenting, as they do, a very garla", "nd of facts\nconnected with the British wild cat (_Felis catus_) up to the present,\nand which I deem ", "valuable from many points of view, but the more\nparticularly as a record of an animal once abundant ", "in England, where it\nhas now apparently almost, if not quite, ceased to exist.\n\n\n\"In England in form", "er days, the wild cat was included amongst the beasts\nof chase, and is often mentioned in royal gran", "ts giving liberty to\ninclose forest land and licence to hunt there (extracts from several\nsuch grant", "s will be found in the _Zoologist_ for 1878, p. 251, and 1880,\np. 251). Nor was it for diversion alo", "ne that the wild cat was hunted.\nIts fur was much used as trimming for dresses, and in this way was ", "worn\neven by nuns at one time. Thus, in Archbishop Corboyle's 'Canons,' anno\n1127, it is ordained 't", "hat no abbess or nun use more costly apparel than\nsuch as is made of lambs' or _cats'_ skins,' and a", "s no other part of the\nanimal but the skin was of any use here, it grew into a proverb that\n'You can", " have nothing of a cat but her skin.'\n\n\"The wild cat is believed to be now extinct, not only in Engl", "and and\nWales, but in a great part of the south of Scotland. About five years\nago a Scottish natural", "ist resident in Stirlingshire (Mr. J. A. Harvie\nBrown) took a great deal of trouble, by means of pri", "nted circulars\naddressed to the principal landowners throughout Scotland and the Isles,\nto ascertain", " the existing haunts of the wild cat in that part of the\nUnited Kingdom. The result of his inquiries", ", embodying some very\ninteresting information, was published in the _Zoologist_ for January,\n1881. T", "he replies which he received indicated pretty clearly, although\nperhaps unexpectedly, that there are", " now no wild cats in Scotland south\nof a line drawn from Oban on the west coast up the Brander Pass ", "to\nDalmally, and thence following the borders of Perthshire to the junction\nof the three counties of", " Perth, Forfar and Aberdeen, northward to\nTomintoul, and so to the city of Inverness. We are assured", " that it is\nonly to the northward and westward of this line that the animal still\nkeeps a footing in", " suitable localities, finding its principal shelter\nin the great deer forests. Thus we see that the ", "wild cat is being\ngradually driven northward before advancing civilisation and the\nincreased supervi", "sion of moors and forests. Just as the reindeer in the\ntwelfth century was driven northward from Eng", "land and found its last\nhome in Caithness, and as the wolf followed it a few centuries later, so\nwe ", "may expect one day that the wild cat will come to be numbered amongst\nthe 'extinct British animals.'", "\n\n\"A recent writer in the new edition of the 'Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica'\n(art. _Cat_) expresses the op", "inion that the wild cat still exists in\nWales and in the north of England, but gives no proof of its", " recent\noccurrence there. From time to time we see reports in the newspapers to\nthe effect that a wi", "ld cat has been shot or trapped in some\nout-of-the-way part of the country; but it usually turns out", " to be a\nlarge example of the domestic cat, coloured like the wild form. It is\nremarkable that when ", "cats in England are allowed to return to a feral\nstate, their offspring, in the course of generation", "s, show a tendency to\nrevert to the wild type of the country; partly, no doubt, in consequence\nof fo", "rmer interbreeding with the wild species when the latter was common\nthroughout all the wooded portio", "ns of the country, and partly because\nthe light-coloured varieties of escaped cats, being more readi", "ly seen\nand destroyed, are gradually eliminated, while the darker wild type is\nperpetuated. The grea", "t increase in size observable in the offspring of\nescaped domestic cats is no doubt due to continuou", "s living on\nfreshly-killed, warm-blooded animals, and to the greater use of the\nmuscles which their ", "new mode of life requires. In this way I think we\nmay account for the size and appearance of the so-", "called 'wild cats'\nwhich are from time to time reported south of the Tweed.\n\n\"Perhaps the last genui", "ne wild cat seen in England was the one shot by\nLord Ravensworth at Eslington, Northumberland, in 18", "53;[A] although so\nrecently as March, 1883, a cat was shot in Bullington Wood,\nLincolnshire, which i", "n point of size, colour, and markings was said to\nbe quite indistinguishable from the wild _Felis ca", "tus_. Bullington Wood\nis one of an almost continuous chain of great woodlands, extending from\nMid-Li", "ncolnshire to near Peterborough. Much of the district has never\nbeen preserved for game, and keepers", " are few and far between; hence the\nwild animals have enjoyed an almost complete immunity from perse", "cution.\nCats are known to have bred in these woods in a wild state for\ngenerations, and there is no ", "improbability that the cat in question may\nhave descended directly from the old British wild cat. Un", "der all the\ncircumstances, however, it seems more likely to be a case of reversion\nunder favourable ", "conditions from the domestic to the wild type.\n\n[A] \"Trans. Tyneside Nat. Field Club,\" 1864, vol. vi", ". p. 123.\n\n\"In Ireland, strange to say, notwithstanding reports to the contrary,\nall endeavours to f", "ind a genuine wild cat have failed, the so-called\n'wild cat' of the natives proving to be the 'marte", "n cat,' a very\ndifferent animal.\n\n\"We thus come back to the question with which we started, namely, ", "the\nquestion of origin of the domestic cat; and the conclusion, I think, at\nwhich we must arrive is,", " that although _Felis catus_ has contributed to\nthe formation of the existing race of domestic cats,", " it is not the sole\nancestor. Several wild species of Egyptian and Indian origin having been\nages ag", "o reclaimed, the interbreeding of their offspring and crossing\nwith other wild species in the countr", "ies to which they have been at\nvarious times exported, has resulted in the gradual production of the", "\nmany varieties, so different in shape and colour, with which we are now\nfamiliar.\"\n\nBefore quitting", " the subject, I would point to the fact that when the\ndomestic cat takes to the woods and becomes wi", "ld, it becomes much\nlarger, stronger, and changes in colour; and there can be little doubt\nthat duri", "ng the centuries of the existence of the cat in England there\nmust have been numberless crosses and ", "intercrosses, both with regard to\nthe _males_ of the domestic cat as with wild _females_, and _vice\n", "vers\u00e2_; yet the curious fact remains that the wild cat still retains its\npeculiar colouring and form", ", as is shown by the skins preserved in the\nBritish Museum and elsewhere.\n\nMr. Darwin, in his \"Voyag", "e of the Beagle,\" 1845 (p. 120), in his notes\nof the first colonists of La Plata, A.D. 1535, says, a", "mong other animals\nthat he saw was \"the common cat altered into a _large_ and _fierce_\nanimal, inhab", "iting the rocky hills,\" etc.\n\nAnother point on which I wish to give my impressions is the act of the", "\ncat in what is termed \"sharpening its claws.\" Mr. Darwin notes certain\ntrees where the jaguars \"_sh", "arpen their claws_,\" and mentions the scars\nwere of different ages; he also thought they did this \"_", "to tear off the\nhorny points_.\" This, I believe, is the received opinion among\nnaturalists; but I di", "ffer _entirely_ from this view of the practice. It\nis a fact, however, and worthy of notice, that al", "l cats do so, even the\ndomestic cat. I had _one_ of the legs of a kitchen table entirely torn\nto pie", "ces by my cats; and after much observation I came to the\nconclusion that it has nothing whatever to ", "do with _sharpening_ the\nclaws, but is done to stretch the muscles and tendons of the feet so\nthat t", "hey work readily and strongly, as the retraction of the claws for\nlengthened periods must tend to co", "ntract the tendons used for the\npurpose of extending or retracting; therefore the cats fix the point", "s of\ntheir claws in something soft, and bear downwards with the whole weight\nof the body, simply to ", "stretch and, by use, to strengthen the ligatures\nthat pull the claws forward. It is also to be noted", " that even the\ndomestic cat goes to one particular place or tree to insert the claws\nand drag forwar", "d the muscles--perhaps even in the leather of an\narm-chair, a costly practice. Why one object is alw", "ays selected is that\nthey may not betray their presence by numerous marks in the\nneighbourhood, if w", "ild, to other animals or their enemies. I have\nmentioned this to my brother, John Jenner Weir, F.L.S", "., and he concurs\nwith me throughout.\n\nI find in Strutt's \"Sports and Pastimes\" that of the names ap", "plied to\ncompanies of animals in the Middle Ages, several are still in use,\nthough many have become ", "obsolete; and also a few of the beasts have\nceased to exist in a wild state. Some were very curious,", " such as a\n_skulk_ of foxes, a _cete_ of badgers, a _huske_ or _down_ of hares, a\n_nest_ of rabbits,", " and a _clowder of cats_, and a _kindle of young\ncats_. Now cats are said to _kitten_, and rabbits _", "kindle_.\n\nThe following shows the value of the cat nearly a thousand years ago; it\nis to be found in", " Bewick's \"Quadrupeds\": \"In the time of Hoel the Good,\nKing of Wales, who died in the year 948, laws", " were made as well to\npreserve as to fix the different prices of animals; among which the cat\nis inc", "luded, as being at that period of great importance, on account of\nits scarcity and utility.\n\n\"The pr", "ice of a kitten, before it could see, was fixed at one penny;\ntill proof could be given of its havin", "g caught a mouse, twopence; after\nwhich it was rated at fourpence, which was a great sum in those da", "ys,\nwhen the value of specie was extremely high. It was likewise required\nthat it should be perfect ", "in its sense of hearing and seeing, should be\na good mouser, have its claws whole, and, if a female,", " be a careful\nnurse. If it failed in any of these good qualities, the seller was to\nforfeit to the b", "uyer a third part of its value. If any one should steal\nor kill a cat that guarded the Prince's gran", "ary, he was either to\nforfeit a milch ewe, her fleece and lamb, or as much wheat as when\npoured on t", "he cat suspended by its feet (its head touching the floor),\nwould form a heap high enough to cover t", "he tip of the former.\" Bewick\nremarks: \"Hence we may conclude that cats were not originally natives ", "of\nthese islands, and from the great care taken to improve the breed of\nthis prolific creature, we m", "ay suppose were but little known at that\nperiod.\"\n\nI scarcely think this the right conclusion, the E", "nglish wild cat being\nanatomically different. In Hone's popular works it is stated that \"Cats\nare su", "pposed to have been brought into England from the island of Cyprus\nby some foreign merchants, who ca", "me hither for tin.\" Mr. Hone further\nsays: \"Wild cats were kept by our ancient kings for hunting. Th", "e\nofficers who had charge of these cats seem to have had appointments of\nequal consequence with the ", "masters of the king's hounds; they were\ncalled _Catatores_.\"\n\nBeaumont and Fletcher in _The Scornful", " Lady_ allude to the hunting of\ncats in the line,\n\n    \"Bring out the _cat-hounds_, I'll make you ta", "ke a tree.\"\n\nBut although large and ferocious, the wild cat was not considered a\nmatch for some of t", "he lesser animals, for in Salmon's \"English\nPhysician,\" 1693, we read that \"The weasel is an enemy t", "o ravens, crows,\nand _cats_, and although cats may sometimes set upon them, yet they can\nscarcely ov", "ercome them.\"\n\nNevertheless, we find in Daniel's \"Rural Sports,\" 1813, that \"_Wild\ncats_ formerly we", "re an object of _sport_ to huntsmen. Thus, Gerard\nCamvile, 6 John, had special licence to hunt the h", "are, fox, and wild\ncat, throughout all the King's _forests_; and 23 Henry III., Earl\nWarren, by givi", "ng Simon de Pierpont a _goshawk_, obtained leave to hunt\nthe buck, doe, hart, hind, hare, fox, goat,", " _cat_, or any other wild\nbeast, in certain lands of Simon's. But it was not for diversion alone\ntha", "t this animal was pursued; for the _skin_ was much used by the nuns\nin their habits, as a _fur_.\"\n\nS", "till it appears from Mr. Charles Darwin's \"Voyage of the Beagle,\" that\ntastes vary. \"Doctor Shaw was", " laughed at for stating the flesh of the\nlion is in great esteem, having no small affinity with veal", ", both in the\ncolour, taste, and flavour. Such certainly is the case with the puma.\nThe Guachos diff", "er in their opinion whether the jaguar is good eating;\nbut were unanimous in saying the _cat_ is _ex", "cellent_.\"\n\nIt is also stated that the Chinese fatten and eat cats with considerable\nrelish; but of ", "this I can obtain no reliable information, some of my\nfriends from China not having heard of the cus", "tom, if such it is.\n\nAgain referring to the skin of the cat, _vide_ Strutt: \"In the\nthirty-seventh y", "ear of the reign of Edward III., it was decreed, after\nenumerating the various kinds of cloth that w", "ere to be worn by the\nnobles, knights, dames, and others, that (Article 2) tradesmen,\nartificers, an", "d men in office, called yeomen, their wives and children,\nshall wear no kind of furs excepting those", " of lambs, of rabbits, of\n_cats_, and of foxes.\" Further: \"No man, unless he be possessed of the\nyea", "rly value of forty shillings, shall wear any furs but black and white\nlambs' skins.\" Lambs' and cats", "' skins were equivalent in value and\norder.\n\nIn the twenty-second year of this monarch's reign, all ", "the former\nstatutes \"against excess in apparel\" were repealed.\n\nMy old friend Fairholt, in his usefu", "l work on costume, says of the\nMiddle Ages: \"The peasants wore cat skins, badger skins, etc.\"\n\nOne o", "f the reasons why the skin of cats was used on cloaks and other\ngarments for trimming, being that it", " showed humility in dress, and not\nby way of affectation or vanity, but for warmth and comfort, it b", "eing of\nthe lowest value of any, with the exception of lambs' skin and badgers';\nand adopted by some", " priests as well as nuns, when wishing to impress\nothers with their deep sense of humility in all th", "ings, even to their\nwearing-apparel. The proof of which Strutt's \"Habits of the\nAnglo-Normans,\" _cir", "c\u00e2_ twelfth century, fully illustrates:\n\n\"William of Malmesbury, speaking of Wulfstan, Bishop of Wor", "cester,\nassures us that he avoided all appearance of pride and ostentation in\nhis dress, and though ", "he was very wealthy, he never used any furs finer\nthan lambs' skin for the lining of his garments. B", "eing blamed for such\nneedless humility by Geoffrey, Bishop of Constans, who told him that 'He\nnot on", "ly could afford, but even ought to wear those of sables, of\nbeavers, or of foxes,' he replied: 'It m", "ay indeed be proper for you\npoliticians, skilful in the affairs of the world, to adorn yourselves in", "\nthe skins of such cunning animals; but for me, who am a plain man, and\nnot subject to change my opi", "nion, the skins of lambs are quite\nsufficient.' 'If,' returned his opponent, 'the finer furs are\nunp", "leasant, you might at least make use of those of the cat.' 'Believe\nme,' answered the facetious prel", "ate, 'the lamb of God is much oftener\nsung in the Church than the cat of God.' This witty retort put", " Geoffrey\nto the blush, and threw the whole company into a violent fit of\nlaughter.\"\n\nOf a very diff", "erent character was the usage of the cat at clerical\nfestivals. In Mill's \"History of the Crusades,\"", " one reads with some\ndegree of horror that \"In the Middle Ages the cat was a very important\npersonag", "e in religious festivals. At Aix, in Provence, on the festival\nof the Corpus Christi, the finest he-", "cat of the country, wrapped like a\nchild in swaddling clothes, was exhibited in a magnificent shrine", " to\npublic admiration. Every knee was bent, every hand strewed flowers or\npoured incense; and pussy ", "was treated in all respects as the god of the\nday. On the festival, however, of St. John (June 24), ", "the poor cat's\nfate was reversed. A number of cats were put in a wicker basket, and\nthrown alive int", "o the midst of a large fire, kindled in the public\nsquare by the bishop and his clergy. Hymns and an", "thems were sung, and\nprocessions were made by the priests and people in honour of the\nsacrifice.\"\n\nW", "hile the foregoing was about being printed, Mr. Edward Hamilton, M.D.,\nwriting to _The Field_, May 1", "1th, 1889, gives information of a wild cat\nbeing shot in Inverness-shire. I therefore insert the par", "agraph, as\nevery record of so scarce an animal is of importance and value,\nespecially when it is des", "criptive. He states: \"A fine specimen of the\nwild cat (_Felis sylvestris_) was sent to me on May 3rd", ", trapped in\nInverness-shire on the Ben Nevis range. It was too much decomposed to\nexhibit. Its dime", "nsions were: from nose to base of tail, 1 foot 11\ninches; length of tail, 1 foot; height at shoulder", ", 1 foot 2 inches; the\nlength of small intestine, 1 foot 8\u00bd inches; and the large intestine, 1\nfoot ", "1 inch.\" It will be seen by these measurements that the animal was\nnot so large as some that have be", "en taken, though excelling in size many\nof the domestic varieties.\n\n\n\n\nCONCERNING CATS.\n\n\nCAT.--Iris", "h, _Cat_; French, _Chat_; Dutch, _Kat_; Danish, _Kat_;\nSwedish, _Katt_; German, _Katti_ or _Katze_; ", "Latin, _Catus_; Italian,\n_Gatto_; Portuguese and Spanish, _Gato_; Polish, _Kot_; Russian, _Kots_;\nTu", "rkish, _Keti_; Welsh, _Cath_; Cornish, _Kath_; Basque, _Catua_;\nArmenian, _Gaz_ or _Katz_. In Armeni", "c, _Kitta_, or _Kaita_, is a male\ncat.\n\n_Abram cat._--This I first thought simply meant a male cat; ", "but I find\nin Nares, \"Abram\" is the corruption of \"auburn,\" so, no doubt, a red or\nsandy tabby cat i", "s intended.\n\n_A Wheen cat, a Queen cat (Catus femina)._--\"Queen\" was used by the\nSaxons to signify t", "he female sex, in that \"queen fugol\" was used for\n\"hen fowl.\" Farmers in Kent and Sussex used also t", "o call heifers \"little\nqueens.\"\n\n_Carl cat._--A boar or he-cat, from the old Saxon carle or karle, a", "\nmale, and cat.\n\n_Cat._--It was used to denote \"Liberty.\" No animal is more impatient of\nrestriction", " or confinement, nor yet _seeming_ to bear it with more\nresignation. The Romans made their goddess o", "f Liberty holding a cup in\none hand and a broken sceptre in the other, with a cat lying at her\nfeet.", " Among the goddesses, Diana is said to have assumed the form of a\ncat. The Egyptians worshipped the ", "cat as an emblem of the moon, not only\nbecause it was more active after sunset, but from the dilatio", "n and\ncontraction of its orb, symbolical of the waxing and waning of the night\ngoddess. But Bailey, ", "in his dictionary, says cats see best as the sun\napproaches, and that their eyesight decays as it go", "es down in the\nevening.

Try, for\ninstance, to make a cat lie still if it wants to go out. Y", "ou may hold it\nat first, then gently relinquish your grasp, stroke it, talk to it,\nfondle it, until ", "it purrs, and purrs with seeming pleasure, but it\n_never once forgets it is restrained_, and _the fi", "rst_ opportunity it\nwill make a sudden dash, and is--gone.\n\nHowever, all animals, more or less, may ", "be trained, and the cat, of\ncourse, is among them, and a notable one. By bringing them up among\nbird", "s, such as canaries, pigeons, chickens, and ducklings, it will\nrespect and not touch them, while tho", "se wild will be immediately\nsacrificed.\n\nOne of the best instances of this was a small collection of", " animals and\nbirds in a large cage that used to be shown by a man by the name of\nAustin, and to whic", "h I have already referred. This man was a lover and\ntrainer of animal life, and an adept. His \"Happy", " Family\" generally\nconsisted of a cat or two, some kittens, rats, mice, rabbits, guinea\npigs, an owl", ", a kestrel falcon, starlings, goldfinches, canaries,\netc.--a most incongruous assembly. Yet among t", "hem all there was a\n_freedom of action_, a self-reliance, and an air of happiness that I\nhave never ", "seen in \"performing cats.\" Mr. Austin informed me that he had\nbeen a number of years studying their ", "different natures, but that he\nfound the cats the most difficult to deal with, only the most gentle\n", "treatment accomplishing the object he had in view. Any fresh\nintroduction had to be done by degrees,", " and shown outside first for some\ntime. It was quite apparent, however, that the cats were _quite at", " their\nease_, and I have seen a canary sitting on the head of the cat, while a\nstarling was resting ", "on the back. But all are gone--Austin and his\npets--and no other reigns in his stead.\n\nOccasionally ", "one sees, at the corners of some of the London streets, a\nman who professes to have _trained_ cats a", "nd birds; the latter,\ncertainly, are clever, but the former have a frightened, scared look,\nand seem", " by no means comfortable. I should say the tuition was on\ndifferent lines to that of Austin. The man", " takes a canary, opens a cat's\nmouth, puts it in, takes it out, _makes_ the cat, or cats, go up a sh", "ort\nladder and down another; then they are _told_ to fight, and placed in\nfront of each other; but f", "ight they will not with their fore-paws, so\nthe _master_ moves their paws for them, _each looking aw", "ay_ from the\nother. There is no training in this but _fear_. There is an innate\ntimidity, the offspr", "ing of long persecution, in the cat that prevents,\nas a rule, its performing in public. Not so the d", "og; time and place\nmatter not to him; from generation to generation he _has been used to\nit_.\n\nIn \"C", "ats Past and Present,\" by Champfleury, there are descriptions of\nperforming cats, and one Valmont de", " Bomare mentions that in a booth at\nthe fair of St. Germain's, during the eighteenth century, there ", "was a\ncat concert, the word \"Miaulique,\" in huge letters, being on the\noutside. In 1789 there is an ", "account of a Venetian giving cat concerts,\nand the facsimile of a print of the seventeenth century p", "icturing a cat\nshowman.\n\n\"In 1758, or the following year, Bisset, the famous animal trainer,\nhired a", " room near the Haymarket, at which he announced a public\nperformance of a 'CATS' OPERA,' supplemente", "d by tricks of a horse, a\ndog, and some monkeys, etc. The 'Cats' Opera' was attended by crowded\nhous", "es, and Bisset cleared a thousand pounds in a few days. After a\nsuccessful season in London, he sold", " some of the animals, and made a\nprovincial tour with the rest, rapidly accumulating a considerable\n", "fortune.\"--MR. FROST'S _Old Showman_.\n\n\"Many years ago a concert was given at Paris, wherein cats we", "re the\nperformers. They were placed in rows, and a monkey beat time to them.\nAccording as he beat th", "e time so the cats mewed; and the historian of\nthe FACT relates that the diversity of the tones whic", "h they emitted\nproduced a very ludicrous effect. This exhibition was announced to the\nParisian publi", "c by the title of _Concert Miaulant.\"--Zoological\nAnecdotes._\n\nAnother specimen of _discipline_ is t", "o be found in \"Menageries.\" The\nwriter says: \"Cats may be taught to perform tricks, such as leaping ", "over\na stick, but they always do such feats unwillingly. There is at present\nan exhibition of cats i", "n Regent Street, who, at the bidding of their\nmaster, an Italian, turn a wheel and draw up water in ", "a bucket, ring a\nbell; and in doing these things begin, continue, and stop as they are\ncommanded. Bu", "t the _commencez_, _continuez_, _arr\u00eatez_ of their keeper\nis always enforced with a threatening eye,", " and often with a severe blow;\nand the poor creatures exhibit the greatest reluctance to proceed wit", "h\ntheir unnatural employments. They have a subdued and piteous look; but\nthe scratches upon their ma", "ster's arms show that _his_ task is not\nalways an easy one.\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\nOf performing cats on ", "the stage, there have been several \"companies\" of\nlate in London, one of which I went to see at the ", "royal Aquarium,\nWestminster; and I am bound to say that the relations between master and\ncats were o", "n a better footing than any that have hitherto come under my\nnotice. On each side of the stage there", " were cat kennels, from which the\ncats made their appearance on a given signal, ran across, on or ov", "er\nwhatever was placed between, and disappeared quickly into the opposite\nkennels. But about it all ", "there was a decided air of _timidity_, and an\neagerness to _get the performance over_, and _done wit", "h it_. When the\ncats came out they were caressed and encouraged, which seemed to have a\nsoothing eff", "ect, and I have a strong apprehension that they received\nsome dainty morsel when they reached their ", "destination. One ran up a\npole at command, over which there was a cap at the top, into which it\ndisa", "ppeared for a few seconds, evidently for some reason, food\n_perhaps_. It then descended. But before ", "this supreme act several cats\nhad crossed a bridge of chairs, stepping only on the backs, until they", "\nreached the opposite house or box into which to retire. The process was\nrepeated, and the performan", "ce varied by two cats crossing the bridge\ntogether, one passing over and the other under the horizon", "tal rung\nbetween the seat and the top of the chair. A long plank was next\nproduced, upon which was p", "laced a row of wine-bottles at intervals; and\nthe cats ran along the plank, winding in and out betwe", "en the bottles,\nfirst to the right, then to the left, without making a mistake. This\npart of the per", "formance was varied by placing on the top of each bottle\na flat disc of thick wood; one of the cats ", "strode then from disc to\ndisc, without displacing or upsetting a bottle, while the other animal\nrepe", "ated its serpentine walk on the plank below. The plank being\nremoved, a number of trestles were brou", "ght in, and placed at intervals\nin a row between the two sets of houses, when the cats, on being cal", "led,\njumped from trestle to trestle, varying the feat by leaping through a\nhoop, which was held up b", "y the trainer between the trestles. To this\nsucceeded a performance on the tight rope, which was not", " the least\ncurious part of the exhibition. A rope being stretched across the arena\nfrom house to hou", "se, the cats walked across in turn, without making a\nmistake. Some white rats were then brought and ", "placed at intervals along\nthe rope, when the cats, re-crossing from one end to the other, strode\nove", "r the rats without injuring them. A repetition of this feat was\nrendered a little more difficult by ", "substituting for rats, which sat\npretty quietly in one place, several white mice and small birds, wh", "ich\nwere more restless, and kept changing their positions. The cats\nre-crossed the rope, and passed ", "over all these obstacles without even\nnoticing the impediments placed in their way, with one or two\n", "exceptions, when they stopped, and cosseted one or more of the white\nrats, two of which rode triumph", "antly on the back of a large black cat.\n\nPerhaps the most odd performance was that of \"Cat Harris,\" ", "an imitator\nof the voice of cats in 1747.\n\n\"When Foote first opened the Haymarket Theatre, amongst o", "ther projects\nhe proposed to entertain the public with imitation of cat-music. For\nthis purpose he e", "ngaged a man famous for his skill in mimicking the\nmewing of the cat. This person was called 'Cat Ha", "rris.' As he did not\nattend the rehearsal of this odd concert, Foote desired Shuter would\nendeavour ", "to find him out and bring him with him. Shuter was directed\nto some court in the Minories, where thi", "s extraordinary musician lived;\nbut, not being able to find the house, Shuter began a cat solo; upon", "\nthis the other looked out of the window, and answered him with a cantata\nof the same sort.

Sometimes the sides were\ncaught by the", " teeth of the players, one on each side, and as the hands\nwere relaxed the faces were apart, then wh", "en drawn out it brought the\nfaces together; the string being let go or not, and caught again as it\nr", "eceded, was according to the will of the players, the catching and\nletting go affording much merrime", "nt. When four or five played, the\nstring rapidly passed from hand to hand until, in the rapidity of ", "the\nmotion, one missed, who then stood out, and so on until only one was\nleft, winning the game of c", "at's, _catch_, or scratch cradle. It was\nvaried also to single and double cradle, according to the n", "umber of\ncrossings of the string. Catch is easily converted into _cat's_, or it\nmight be so called f", "rom the _catching_ or clawing at, to get and to\nhold, the entanglement.\n\n\nCAT-TRAP, BAT, AND BALL.[L", "]\n\nWith the form of the trap our readers are, doubtless, acquainted; it\nwill only be necessary for u", "s to give the laws of the game. Two\nboundaries are equally placed at some distance from the trap, be", "tween\nwhich it is necessary for the ball to pass when struck by the batsman;\nif it fall outside eith", "er of them he loses his innings. Innings are\ndrawn for, and the player who wins places the ball in t", "he spoon of the\ntrap, touches the trigger with the bat, and, as the ball ascends from\nthe trap, stri", "kes it as far as he can. One of the other players (who may\nbe from two to half-a-dozen) endeavours t", "o catch it. If he do so before\nit reaches the ground, or hops more than once, or if the striker miss", "\nthe ball when he aims at it, or hits the trigger more than once without\nstriking the ball, he loses", " his innings, and the next in order, which\nmust previously be agreed on, takes his place. Should the", " ball be fairly\nstruck, and not caught, as we have stated, the out-player, into whose\nhand it comes,", " bowls it from the place where he picks it up, at the\ntrap, which if he hit, the striker is out; if ", "he miss it the striker\ncounts one towards the game, which may be any number decided on. There\nis als", "o a practice in some places, when the bowler has sent in the ball,\nof the striker's guessing the num", "ber of bats' lengths it is from the\ntrap; if he guess within the real number he reckons that number ", "toward\nhis game, but if he guess more than there really are he loses his\ninnings. It is not necessar", "y to make the game in one innings.\n\n\nPUSS IN THE CORNER.[L]\n\n[L] The Boy's Own Book.\n\nThis is a very", " simple, but, at the same time, a very lively and amusing\ngame. It is played by five only; and the p", "lace chosen for the sport\nshould be a square court or yard with four corners, or any place where\nthe", "re are four trees or posts, about equidistant from each other, and\nforming the four points of a squa", "re. Each of these points or corners is\noccupied by a player; the fifth, who is called Puss, stands i", "n the\ncentre. The game now commences; the players exchange corners in all\ndirections; it is the obje", "ct of the one who stands out to occupy any of\nthe corners which may remain vacant for an instant dur", "ing the exchanges.\nWhen he succeeds in so doing, that player who is left without a corner\nbecomes th", "e puss. It is to be observed, that if A and B attempt to\nexchange corners, and A gets to B's corner,", " but B fails to reach A's\nbefore the player who stands out gets there, it is B and not A who\nbecomes", " Puss.\n\n\nCAT AND MOUSE.\n\nThis is a French sport. The toys with which it is played consist of two\nfla", "t bits of hard wood, the edges of one of which are notched. The game\nis played by two only; they are", " both blindfolded and tied to the ends of\na long string, which is fastened in the centre to a post, ", "by a loose\nknot, so as to play easily in the evolutions made by the players. The\nparty who plays the", " mouse occasionally scrapes the toys together, and\nthe other, who plays the cat, attracted by the so", "und, endeavours to\ncatch him.\n\n\nCAT AND MOUSE-HUNTING.\n\nThe game of \"Hunt the Slipper\" used frequent", "ly to be called \"Cat and\nMouse-hunting.\" It is generally played with a slipper, shoe, or even a\npiec", "e of wood, which was called the mouse, the centre player being the\ncat, and trying to catch or find ", "the mouse. The \"Boy's Own Book\" thus\ndescribes the game, but _not_ as Cat and Mouse: \"Several young ", "persons\nsit on the ground in a circle, a slipper is given them, and one--who\ngenerally volunteers to", " accept the office in order to begin the\ngame--stands in the centre, and whose business it is to 'ch", "ase the\nslipper by its sound.' The parties who are seated pass it round so as to\nprevent, if possibl", "e, its being found in the possession of any\nindividual. In order that the player in the centre may k", "now where the\nslipper is, it is occasionally tapped on the ground and then suddenly\nhanded on to rig", "ht or left. When the slipper is found in the possession\nof any one in the circle, by the player who ", "is hunting it, the party on\nwhom it is found takes the latter player's place.\"\n\n\nTIP-CAT.\n\nIs a game", " played with sticks of a certain length and a piece of wood\nsharpened off at each end, which is call", "ed the \"cat.\" A ring is made on\nthe ground with chalk, or the pointed part of the cat, which is then", "\nplaced in the centre. One end being smartly struck by the player, it\nsprings spinning upwards; as i", "t rises it is again struck, and thus\nknocked to a considerable distance. It is played in two ways, o", "ne being\nfor the antagonist to guess _how many sticks length_ it is off the ring,\nwhich is measured,", " and if right he goes in; or he may elect to pitch the\ncat, if possible, into the ring, which if he ", "succeeds in doing, he then\nhas the pleasure of knocking the wood called the cat recklessly, he\nknows", " not whither, until it alights somewhere, on something or some one.\n\n\nCAT I' THE HOLE.[M]\n\n[M] Jamie", "son's \"Scottish Dictionary.\"\n\nThe name of a game well known in Fife, and perhaps in other counties. ", "If\nseven boys are to play, six holes are made at certain distances. Each of\nthe six stands at a hole", ", with a short stick in his hand; the seventh\nstands at a certain distance, holding a ball. When he ", "gives the word, or\nmakes the sign agreed upon, all the six must change holes, each running\nto his ne", "ighbour's hole, and putting his stick in the hole which he has\nnewly seized. In making this change, ", "the boy who has the ball tries to\nput it into the empty hole. If he succeeds in this, the boy who ha", "d not\nhis stick (for the stick is the _cat_) in the hole for which he had run\nis put out, and must t", "ake the ball. When the _Cat_ is _in the Hole_, it\nis against the laws of the game to put the ball in", "to it.\n\n\n\n\nNURSERY RHYMES AND STORIES.\n\n\nThese are as plentiful as blackberries, and are far too num", "erous to be\ntreated of here. Some are very old, such as \"Puss in Boots,\"\n\"Whittington and his Cat,\" ", "\"Hey, diddle, diddle!\" etc. Some have a\npolitical meaning, others satirical, others amusing, funny, ", "or\ninstructive, while a few are unmeaning jangles. \"Dame Trot and her\nWonderful Cat,\" \"The Cat and t", "he Mouse,\" and, later, \"The White Cat,\"\n\"The Adventures of Miss Minette Cattina,\" are familiar to ma", "ny of the\npresent time. Of the older stories and rhymes there are enough to fill a\nbook; not of or a", "bout the cat in particular, possibly; but even\nthat--the old combined with those of modern date--mig", "ht be done; and for\nsuch information and perusal the \"Popular Rhymes,\" by J. O. Halliwell,\nwill be f", "ound very interesting, space preventing the subject being\namplified here. Nor do they come within th", "e scope and intention for\nwhich I have written respecting the cat.\n\n\n\n\nFISHING CATS.\n\n\nHaving just c", "ome across a communication made to _The Kelso Mail_, in\n1880, by a correspondent giving the signatur", "e of \"March Brown,\" bearing\non the subject to which I have already alluded (\"Fishing Cats\"), I deem\n", "it worthy of notice, corroborating, as it does, the statement so often\nmade, and almost as often den", "ied, that cats are adept fishers, not only\nfor food, but likewise for the sport and pleasure they so", " derive. The\nwriter says that \"for several years it has been my happy fortune to fish\nthe lovely Twe", "ed for salmon and trout. From Tweed Well to Coldstream is\na long stretch, but I have fished it all, ", "and believe that though other\nrivers have their special advantages, there is not one in Britain whic", "h\noffers such varied and successful angling as the grand Border stream.\nMany have been the boatmen w", "hom I have employed whilst fishing for\nsalmon, and all were fairly honest, except in the matter of a", " little\npoaching. Some had the complaint more fiercely than others, and some so\nbad as to be incurab", "le. One of the afflicted (Donald by name) was an\nexcellent boatman by day; as to his nocturnal doing", "s I deemed it best\nnot to inquire, except on those occasions when he needed a holiday to\nattend a su", "mmons with which the police had favoured him. Now any one who\nhas studied the proclivities of poache", "rs, knows that they have wonderful\npowers over all animals who depend upon them, such as dogs, cats,", "\nferrets, tame badgers, otters, etc., etc. Donald's special favourite was\na lady-cat, which followed", " him in his frequent fishings, and took deep\ninterest in the sport. Near to his cottage on the river", "-bank was a dam\nor weir, over which the water trickled here and there a few inches deep.\nIn the even", "ings of spring and summer Donald was generally to be found\nfishing upon this favourite stretch with ", "artificial fly for trout, and,\nbeing an adept in the art, he seldom fished in vain. Pretty puss alwa", "ys\nkept close behind him, watching the trail of the mimic flies till a fish\nwas hooked, and then her", " eagerness and love of sport could not be\ncontrolled, and so soon as the captive was in shoal water,", " in sprang\npuss up to the shoulders, and, fixing her claws firmly in the fish,\nbrought it to the ban", "k, when, with a caress from Donald, she again took\nher place behind him till another trout was on th", "e line, and the sport\nwas repeated. In this way did puss and her master pass the evenings,\neach prou", "d of the other's doings, and happy in their companionship. Such\nwas the affection of the cat for her", " master, that she could not even\nbear to be separated from him by day. Donald had charge of a ferry\n", "across the river, and no sooner did a bell at the opposite side of the\nstream give notice that a pas", "senger was ready to voyage across, than\ndown scampered puss to the boat, and, leaping in, she journe", "yed with her\nmaster to the further side, and again returned, gravely watching each\nstroke of the oar", ". Many a voyage did she thus daily make, and I\nquestion, with these luxurious boatings and the excit", "ing fishing in the\nevenings, if ever cat was more truly happy. The love of fishing once\ndeveloped it", "self to the disturbance of my own sport. With careful\nprevision, my boatman had, in the floods of No", "vember and December,\nsecured a plentiful supply of minnows, to be held in readiness till\nwanted in m", "y fishings for salmon in the ensuing February and March. The\nminnows were placed in a well two or th", "ree feet deep, and the cold\nspring water rendered them as tough as angler could desire. All went\nwel", "l for the first few days of the salmon fishing; the minnows were\ndeemed admirable for the purpose, a", "nd the supply ample for our needs;\nbut this good fortune was not to last. One morning the boatman re", "ported\na serious diminution of stock in the well, and on the following day\nthings were still worse. ", "Suspicion fell on more than one honest person,\nand we determined to watch late and early till the re", "al thief was\ndiscovered. When the guidwife and bairns were abed, the boatman kept\nwatch from the cot", "tage window, and by the aid of a bright moon the\nmystery was soon solved. At the well-side stood pus", "s, the favourite of\nthe household; with arched back and extended paw she took her prey. When\nan unfo", "rtunate minnow approached the surface, sharp was the dash made by\npuss, arm and shoulder were boldly", " immersed, and straightway the victim\nlay gasping on the bank. Fishing in this manner, she soon capt", "ured\nhalf-a-dozen, and was then driven away. From that evening the well was\nalways covered with a ne", "t, which scared puss into enforced honesty. By\nnature cats love dry warmth and sunshine, whilst they", " hate water and\ncold. Who has not seen the misery of a cat when compelled to step into a\nshallow poo", "l, and how she examines her wet paw with anxiety, holding it\nup as something to be pitied? And yet t", "he passion of destructiveness is\nso strong within them as to overcome even their aversion to water.\"", "\n\nThe following still more extraordinary circumstance of a cat fishing in\nthe sea, appeared in _The ", "Plymouth Journal_, June, 1828: \"There is now\nat the battery on the Devil's Point, a cat, which is an", " expert catcher\nof the finny tribe, being in the constant habit of diving into the sea,\nand bringing", " up the fish alive in her mouth, and depositing them in the\nguard-room for the use of the soldiers. ", "She is now seven years old, and\nhas long been a useful caterer. It is supposed that her pursuits of ", "the\nwater-rats first taught her to venture into the water, to which it is\nwell known puss has a natu", "ral aversion. She is as fond of the water as a\nNewfoundland dog, and takes her regular peregrination", "s along the rocks\nat its edge, looking out for her prey, ready to dive for them at a\nmoment's notice", ".\"--ED.\n\n\n\n\nCATS AND HORSES.\n\n\nFrom time immemorial cats have been kept in stables, and when this is", "\nthe case there is generally a friendly feeling between one or other of\nthe horses and the cat or ca", "ts. Such I have known with the heavy,\nponderous cart-horse and his feline companion; such was the ca", "se in my\nstable, and so in many others. Cats are as a rule fond of horses, and\nthe feeling is genera", "lly reciprocated. Several of our \"race winners\"\nhave had their favourites at home, among others the ", "well-known\n\"Foxhall.\" \"Many famous horses have had their stable cats, and the\ngreat, amiable Foxhall", " has adopted a couple of kittens, if it would not\nbe more correct to say that they have adopted him.", " A pretty little white\nand a tabby, own brothers, live in Foxhall's box, and when Hatcher, his\natten", "dant, has rubbed him over, and put on his clothing, he takes up the\nkittens from the corner of the b", "ox where they have been waiting, and\ngently throws them on Foxhall's back. They are quite accustomed", " to the\nprocess, and, catching hold, soon settle down and curl themselves up\ninto little fluffy ball", "s, much to their own satisfaction and to the good\nhorse's likewise, to judge from the way in which h", "e turns and watches\nthe operation.\"\n\nIn Lawrence's \"History of the Horse,\" it is stated that the cel", "ebrated\nArabian stallion, Godolphin, and a black cat were for many years the\nwarmest friends. When t", "he horse died, in 1753, the cat sat upon his\ncarcase till it was put under ground, and then, crawlin", "g slowly and\nreluctantly away, was never seen again till her dead body was found in a\nhay-loft. Stub", "bs painted the portraits of the Arabian and the cat. There\nwas a hunter in the King's stables at Win", "dsor, to which a cat was so\nattached, that whenever he was in the stable the creature would never\nle", "ave her usual seat on the horse's back, and the horse was so well\npleased with the attention that, t", "o accommodate his friend, he slept, as\nhorses will sometimes do, standing.\n\n\n\n\n\"GRAMMER'S CAT AND OU", "RS.\"\n\nBY JOHN TABOIS TREGELLAS.\n\n\nJohn Tabois Tregellas (1792-1865), born at St. Agnes.

What time did she\ncome in?\"\n\n\"She did not come in all night, general,\" said my landlady, in ", "a\ntroubled voice. \"She has not come home yet, and I am very anxious about\nit.\"\n\n\"No need of that, I ", "trust,\" I said, reassuringly; \"she will come this\nmorning, no doubt.\"\n\n\"I don't know.

She had not\nreturned. My poor landlady was almost in hysterics, though she tried\n", "hard to control herself.\n\nTo satisfy her I set off to consult the police. My mission was not\nencoura", "ging.

Their poor\nmother left them here, and if she ever does return she shall find the", "m\nhere. And if she never returns, then----\"\n\n_And she never did return_, and no tidings of her fate ", "ever reached us.\nIf she was enticed away by artful blandishments, or kidnapped by cruel\nviolence, we", " knew not. But I honestly believe the latter. Either way, it\nwas her fatal beauty that led her to de", "struction; for, as I have said\nbefore, she was the most perfect creature, the most beautiful Maltese", "\ncat, that I ever beheld in my life! I am sure she never deserted her two\npretty little kittens of h", "er own accord.
