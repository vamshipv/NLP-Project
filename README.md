For the main task in the implementation of semantic similarity search we have used FAISS and Sentence Transformers as demonstrated in the code. At first a sample documents set are defined and it is transformed into vector embeddings using some specialized training methods from the sentence transformers library using an all-MiniLM-L6-v2. These embeddings capture the semantic meaning of each sentence in high dimensional space. By using Euclidean (L2) distance, these embeddings are then indexed by using FAISS which is a library designed for efficient similarity search. For a newly entered query vector after the indexing the most similar document vectors are identified and retrieved using FAISS.


So here in the code we defined two distinct ways of expressing a similar inquiry, both of which ask the question "do we prefer books or movies?". Every query is accompanied by the same model and then it is transmitted to the FAISS index for identification of two most similar documents. The output will be the matched documents with their distances, and shows how close to each document embedding is the query embedded. The comparison output of both queries enables an examination of FAISS's ability to retrieve semantically similar content, despite differences in phrasing, and offers insights into the effectiveness of vector-based search over traditional keywordÂ matching.
