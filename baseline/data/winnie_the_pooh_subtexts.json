That was a\nlong time ago, and when we said good-bye, we took the name with us, a", "s\nwe didn't think the swan would want it any more. Well, when Edward Bear\nsaid that he would like an exciting name all to himself, Christopher\nRobin said at once, without stopping to think, that he wa", "s\nWinnie-the-Pooh. And he was. So, as I have explained the Pooh part, I\nwill now explain the rest of it.\n\nYou can't be in London for long without going to the Zoo. There are some\npeople who begin the ", "Zoo at the beginning, called WAYIN, and walk as\nquickly as they can past every cage until they get to the one called\nWAYOUT, but the nicest people go straight to the animal they love the\nmost, and sta", "y there. So when Christopher Robin goes to the Zoo, he goes\nto where the Polar Bears are, and he whispers something to the third\nkeeper from the left, and doors are unlocked, and we wander through dar", "k\npassages and up steep stairs, until at last we come to the special cage,\nand the cage is opened, and out trots something brown and furry, and\nwith a happy cry of \"Oh, Bear!\" Christopher Robin rushes", " into its arms.\nNow this bear's name is Winnie, which shows what a good name for bears\nit is, but the funny thing is that we can't remember whether Winnie is\ncalled after Pooh, or Pooh after Winnie. W", "e did know once, but we have\nforgotten....\n\nI had written as far as this when Piglet looked up and said in his\nsqueaky voice, \"What about _Me_?\" \"My dear Piglet,\" I said, \"the whole\nbook is about you.", "\" \"So it is about Pooh,\" he squeaked. You see what it\nis. He is jealous because he thinks Pooh is having a Grand Introduction\nall to himself. Pooh is the favourite, of course, there's no denying it,\nb", "ut Piglet comes in for a good many things which Pooh misses; because\nyou can't take Pooh to school without everybody knowing it, but Piglet\nis so small that he slips into a pocket, where it is very co", "mforting to\nfeel him when you are not quite sure whether twice seven is twelve or\ntwenty-two. Sometimes he slips out and has a good look in the ink-pot,\nand in this way he has got more education than ", "Pooh, but Pooh doesn't\nmind. Some have brains, and some haven't, he says, and there it is.\n\nAnd now all the others are saying, \"What about _Us_?\" So perhaps the\nbest thing to do is to stop writing Int", "roductions and get on with the\nbook.\n\n                                                                A.

It is, as far as he knows,\nthe only way of coming downstairs, but sometimes he feels that there\nreally is another way, if", " only he could stop bumping for a moment and\nthink of it. And then he feels that perhaps there isn't. Anyhow, here he\nis at the bottom, and ready to be introduced to you. Winnie-the-Pooh.\n\nWhen I firs", "t heard his name, I said, just as you are going to say, \"But\nI thought he was a boy?\"\n\n\"So did I,\" said Christopher Robin.\n\n\"Then you can't call him Winnie?\"\n\n\"I don't.\"\n\n\"But you said----\"\n\n\"He's Win", "nie-ther-Pooh. Don't you know what '_ther_' means?\"\n\n\"Ah, yes, now I do,\" I said quickly; and I hope you do too, because it\nis all the explanation you are going to get.\n\nSometimes Winnie-the-Pooh like", "s a game of some sort when he comes\ndownstairs, and sometimes he likes to sit quietly in front of the fire\nand listen to a story. This evening----\n\n\"What about a story?\" said Christopher Robin.\n\n\"_Wha", "t_ about a story?\" I said.\n\n\"Could you very sweetly tell Winnie-the-Pooh one?\"\n\n\"I suppose I could,\" I said. \"What sort of stories does he like?\"\n\n\"About himself. Because he's _that_ sort of Bear.\"\n\n\"", "Oh, I see.\"\n\n\"So could you very sweetly?\"\n\n\"I'll try,\" I said.\n\nSo I tried.\n\n                 *        *        *        *        *\n\nOnce upon a time, a very long time ago now, about last Friday,\nWinn", "ie-the-Pooh lived in a forest all by himself under the name of\nSanders.\n\n(_\"What does 'under the name' mean?\" asked Christopher Robin._\n\n\"_It means he had the name over the door in gold letters, and l", "ived\nunder it._\"\n\n_\"Winnie-the-Pooh wasn't quite sure,\" said Christopher Robin._\n\n_\"Now I am,\" said a growly voice._\n\n_\"Then I will go on,\" said I._)\n\nOne day when he was out walking, he came to an op", "en place in the middle\nof the forest, and in the middle of this place was a large oak-tree,\nand, from the top of the tree, there came a loud buzzing-noise.\n\nWinnie-the-Pooh sat down at the foot of the", " tree, put his head between\nhis paws and began to think.\n\nFirst of all he said to himself: \"That buzzing-noise means something.\nYou don't get a buzzing-noise like that, just buzzing and buzzing,\nwitho", "ut its meaning something. If there's a buzzing-noise, somebody's\nmaking a buzzing-noise, and the only reason for making a buzzing-noise\nthat _I_ know of is because you're a bee.\"\n\nThen he thought anot", "her long time, and said: \"And the only reason for\nbeing a bee that I know of is making honey.\"\n\nAnd then he got up, and said: \"And the only reason for making honey is\nso as _I_ can eat it.\" So he bega", "n to climb the tree.\n\nHe climbed and he climbed and he climbed, and as he climbed he sang a\nlittle song to himself. It went like this:\n\n    Isn't it funny\n    How a bear likes honey?\n    Buzz! Buzz! B", "uzz!\n    I wonder why he does?\n\nThen he climbed a little further ... and a little further ... and\nthen just a little further. By that time he had thought of another song.\n\n    It's a very funny though", "t that, if Bears were Bees,\n    They'd build their nests at the _bottom_ of trees.\n    And that being so (if the Bees were Bears),\n    We shouldn't have to climb up all these stairs.\n\nHe was getting r", "ather tired by this time, so that is why he sang a\nComplaining Song. He was nearly there now, and if he just stood on that\nbranch ...\n\n_Crack!_\n\n\"Oh, help!\" said Pooh, as he dropped ten feet on the br", "anch below him.\n\n\"If only I hadn't----\" he said, as he bounced twenty feet on to the next\nbranch.\n\n\"You see, what I _meant_ to do,\" he explained, as he turned\nhead-over-heels, and crashed on to anothe", "r branch thirty feet below,\n\"what I _meant_ to do----\"\n\n\"Of course, it _was_ rather----\" he admitted, as he slithered very\nquickly through the next six branches.\n\n\"It all comes, I suppose,\" he decided", ", as he said good-bye to the last\nbranch, spun round three times, and flew gracefully into a gorse-bush,\n\"it all comes of _liking_ honey so much. Oh, help!\"\n\nHe crawled out of the gorse-bush, brushed ", "the prickles from his nose,\nand began to think again. And the first person he thought of was\nChristopher Robin.\n\n(_\"Was that me?\" said Christopher Robin in an awed voice, hardly daring\nto believe it._", "\n\n\"_That was you._\"\n\n_Christopher Robin said nothing, but his eyes got larger and larger, and\nhis face got pinker and pinker._)\n\nSo Winnie-the-Pooh went round to his friend Christopher Robin, who live", "d\nbehind a green door in another part of the forest.\n\n\"Good morning, Christopher Robin,\" he said.\n\n\"Good morning, Winnie-_ther_-Pooh,\" said you.\n\n\"I wonder if you've got such a thing as a balloon abou", "t you?\"\n\n\"A balloon?\"\n\n\"Yes, I just said to myself coming along: 'I wonder if Christopher Robin\nhas such a thing as a balloon about him?' I just said it to myself,\nthinking of balloons, and wondering.", "\"\n\n\"What do you want a balloon for?\" you said.\n\nWinnie-the-Pooh looked round to see that nobody was listening, put his\npaw to his mouth, and said in a deep whisper: \"_Honey!_\"\n\n\"But you don't get hone", "y with balloons!\"\n\n\"_I_ do,\" said Pooh.\n\nWell, it just happened that you had been to a party the day before at\nthe house of your friend Piglet, and you had balloons at the party. You\nhad had a big gre", "en balloon; and one of Rabbit's relations had had a big\nblue one, and had left it behind, being really too young to go to a\nparty at all; and so you had brought the green one _and_ the blue one\nhome w", "ith you.\n\n\"Which one would you like?\" you asked Pooh.\n\nHe put his head between his paws and thought very carefully.\n\n\"It's like this,\" he said. \"When you go after honey with a balloon, the\ngreat thing", " is not to let the bees know you're coming. Now, if you have\na green balloon, they might think you were only part of the tree, and\nnot notice you, and, if you have a blue balloon, they might think you", "\nwere only part of the sky, and not notice you, and the question is:\nWhich is most likely?\"\n\n\"Wouldn't they notice _you_ underneath the balloon?\" you asked.\n\n\"They might or they might not,\" said Winni", "e-the-Pooh. \"You never can\ntell with bees.\" He thought for a moment and said: \"I shall try to look\nlike a small black cloud. That will deceive them.\"\n\n\"Then you had better have the blue balloon,\" you ", "said; and so it was\ndecided.\n\nWell, you both went out with the blue balloon, and you took your gun\nwith you, just in case, as you always did, and Winnie-the-Pooh went to a\nvery muddy place that he kne", "w of, and rolled and rolled until he was\nblack all over; and then, when the balloon was blown up as big as big,\nand you and Pooh were both holding on to the string, you let go\nsuddenly, and Pooh Bear ", "floated gracefully up into the sky, and stayed\nthere--level with the top of the tree and about twenty feet away from\nit.\n\n\"Hooray!\" you shouted.\n\n\"Isn't that fine?\" shouted Winnie-the-Pooh down to you", ". \"What do I look\nlike?\"\n\n\"You look like a Bear holding on to a balloon,\" you said.\n\n\"Not,\" said Pooh anxiously, \"--not like a small black cloud in a blue\nsky?\"\n\n\"Not very much.\"\n\n\"Ah, well, perhaps f", "rom up here it looks different. And, as I say, you\nnever can tell with bees.\"\n\nThere was no wind to blow him nearer to the tree, so there he stayed. He\ncould see the honey, he could smell the honey, b", "ut he couldn't quite\nreach the honey.\n\nAfter a little while he called down to you.\n\n\"Christopher Robin!\" he said in a loud whisper.\n\n\"Hallo!\"\n\n\"I think the bees _suspect_ something!\"\n\n\"What sort of th", "ing?\"\n\n\"I don't know. But something tells me that they're _suspicious_!\"\n\n\"Perhaps they think that you're after their honey.\"\n\n\"It may be that. You never can tell with bees.\"\n\nThere was another little", " silence, and then he called down to you again.\n\n\"Christopher Robin!\"\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"Have you an umbrella in your house?\"\n\n\"I think so.\"\n\n\"I wish you would bring it out here, and walk up and down with it, ", "and\nlook up at me every now and then, and say 'Tut-tut, it looks like rain.'\nI think, if you did that, it would help the deception which we are\npractising on these bees.\"\n\nWell, you laughed to yoursel", "f, \"Silly old Bear!\" but you didn't say it\naloud because you were so fond of him, and you went home for your\numbrella.\n\n\"Oh, there you are!\" called down Winnie-the-Pooh, as soon as you got\nback to the", " tree. \"I was beginning to get anxious. I have discovered\nthat the bees are now definitely Suspicious.\"\n\n\"Shall I put my umbrella up?\" you said.\n\n\"Yes, but wait a moment. We must be practical. The imp", "ortant bee to\ndeceive is the Queen Bee. Can you see which is the Queen Bee from down\nthere?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"A pity. Well, now, if you walk up and down with your umbrella, saying,\n'Tut-tut, it looks like rai", "n,' I shall do what I can by singing a little\nCloud Song, such as a cloud might sing.... Go!\"\n\nSo, while you walked up and down and wondered if it would rain,\nWinnie-the-Pooh sang this song:\n\n    How ", "sweet to be a Cloud\n      Floating in the Blue!\n    Every little cloud\n    _Always_ sings aloud.\n\n    \"How sweet to be a Cloud\n      Floating in the Blue!\"\n    It makes him very proud\n    To be a litt", "le cloud.\n\nThe bees were still buzzing as suspiciously as ever. Some of them,\nindeed, left their nests and flew all round the cloud as it began the\nsecond verse of this song, and one bee sat down on t", "he nose of the cloud\nfor a moment, and then got up again.\n\n\"Christopher--_ow!_--Robin,\" called out the cloud.\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"I have just been thinking, and I have come to a very important\ndecision. _These ", "are the wrong sort of bees._\"\n\n\"Are they?\"\n\n\"Quite the wrong sort. So I should think they would make the wrong sort\nof honey, shouldn't you?\"\n\n\"Would they?\"\n\n\"Yes. So I think I shall come down.\"\n\n\"How", "?\" asked you.\n\nWinnie-the-Pooh hadn't thought about this. If he let go of the string,\nhe would fall--_bump_--and he didn't like the idea of that. So he\nthought for a long time, and then he said:\n\n\"Chr", "istopher Robin, you must shoot the balloon with your gun. Have you\ngot your gun?\"\n\n\"Of course I have,\" you said. \"But if I do that, it will spoil the\nballoon,\" you said.\n\n\"But if you _don't_,\" said Po", "oh, \"I shall have to let go, and that would\nspoil _me_.\"\n\nWhen he put it like this, you saw how it was, and you aimed very\ncarefully at the balloon, and fired.\n\n\"_Ow!_\" said Pooh.\n\n\"Did I miss?\" you a", "sked.\n\n\"You didn't exactly _miss_,\" said Pooh, \"but you missed the _balloon_.\"\n\n\"I'm so sorry,\" you said, and you fired again, and this time you hit the\nballoon, and the air came slowly out, and Winni", "e-the-Pooh floated down\nto the ground.\n\nBut his arms were so stiff from holding on to the string of the balloon\nall that time that they stayed up straight in the air for more than a\nweek, and whenever", " a fly came and settled on his nose he had to blow it\noff. And I think--but I am not sure--that _that_ is why he was always\ncalled Pooh.\n\n                 *        *        *        *        *\n\n\"Is th", "at the end of the story?\" asked Christopher Robin.\n\n\"That's the end of that one. There are others.\"\n\n\"About Pooh and Me?\"\n\n\"And Piglet and Rabbit and all of you. Don't you remember?\"\n\n\"I do remember, ", "and then when I try to remember, I forget.\"\n\n\"That day when Pooh and Piglet tried to catch the Heffalump----\"\n\n\"They didn't catch it, did they?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Pooh couldn't, because he hasn't any brain. Di", "d _I_ catch it?\"\n\n\"Well, that comes into the story.\"\n\nChristopher Robin nodded.\n\n\"I do remember,\" he said, \"only Pooh doesn't very well, so that's why he\nlikes having it told to him again. Because the", "n it's a real story and\nnot just a remembering.\"\n\n\"That's just how _I_ feel,\" I said.\n\nChristopher Robin gave a deep sigh, picked his Bear up by the leg, and\nwalked off to the door, trailing Pooh behi", "nd him. At the door he turned\nand said, \"Coming to see me have my bath?\"\n\n\"I might,\" I said.\n\n\"I didn't hurt him when I shot him, did I?\"\n\n\"Not a bit.\"\n\nHe nodded and went out, and in a moment I heard", " Winnie-the-Pooh--_bump,\nbump, bump_--going up the stairs behind him.\n\n\n\n\n                               CHAPTER II\n\n                     IN WHICH POOH GOES VISITING AND\n                         GETS ", "INTO A TIGHT PLACE\n\n\nEdward Bear, known to his friends as Winnie-the-Pooh, or Pooh for\nshort, was walking through the forest one day, humming proudly to\nhimself. He had made up a little hum that very ", "morning, as he was doing\nhis Stoutness Exercises in front of the glass: _Tra-la-la, tra-la-la_,\nas he stretched up as high as he could go, and then _Tra-la-la,\ntra-la--oh, help!--la_, as he tried to r", "each his toes. After breakfast\nhe had said it over and over to himself until he had learnt it off by\nheart, and now he was humming it right through, properly.

Next to his house was a piece of broken\nboard which had: \"TRESPASSERS W\" on it. When Christopher Ro", "bin asked the\nPiglet what it meant, he said it was his grandfather's name, and had\nbeen in the family for a long time, Christopher Robin said you\n_couldn't_ be called Trespassers W, and Piglet said ye", "s, you could,\nbecause his grandfather was, and it was short for Trespassers Will,\nwhich was short for Trespassers William.

This--whatever-it-was--has been joined by\nanother--whatever-it-is--and the two of them are now proceeding\nin company. Would you mind coming with me, Piglet, in case they\nturn out to ", "be Hostile Animals?\"\n\nPiglet scratched his ear in a nice sort of way, and said that he had\nnothing to do until Friday, and would be delighted to come, in case it\nreally _was_ a Woozle.\n\n\"You mean, in ", "case it really is two Woozles,\" said Winnie-the-Pooh, and\nPiglet said that anyhow he had nothing to do until Friday. So off they\nwent together.\n\nThere was a small spinney of larch trees just here, and", " it seemed as if\nthe two Woozles, if that is what they were, had been going round this\nspinney; so round this spinney went Pooh and Piglet after them; Piglet\npassing the time by telling Pooh what his ", "Grandfather Trespassers W had\ndone to Remove Stiffness after Tracking, and how his Grandfather\nTrespassers W had suffered in his later years from Shortness of Breath,\nand other matters of interest, an", "d Pooh wondering what a Grandfather was\nlike, and if perhaps this was Two Grandfathers they were after now, and,\nif so, whether he would be allowed to take one home and keep it, and\nwhat Christopher R", "obin would say. And still the tracks went on in front\nof them....\n\nSuddenly Winnie-the-Pooh stopped, and pointed excitedly in front of him.\n\"_Look!_\"\n\n\"_What?_\" said Piglet, with a jump. And then, to ", "show that he hadn't\nbeen frightened, he jumped up and down once or twice more in an\nexercising sort of way.\n\n\"The tracks!\" said Pooh. \"_A third animal has joined the other two!_\"\n\n\"Pooh!\" cried Piglet", ". \"Do you think it is another Woozle?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Pooh, \"because it makes different marks. It is either Two\nWoozles and one, as it might be, Wizzle, or Two, as it might be, Wizzles\nand one, if so it ", "is, Woozle. Let us continue to follow them.\"\n\nSo they went on, feeling just a little anxious now, in case the three\nanimals in front of them were of Hostile Intent. And Piglet wished very\nmuch that hi", "s Grandfather T. W. were there, instead of elsewhere, and\nPooh thought how nice it would be if they met Christopher Robin suddenly\nbut quite accidentally, and only because he liked Christopher Robin s", "o\nmuch. And then, all of a sudden, Winnie-the-Pooh stopped again, and\nlicked the tip of his nose in a cooling manner, for he was feeling more\nhot and anxious than ever in his life before. _There were ", "four animals\nin front of them!_\n\n\"Do you see, Piglet? Look at their tracks! Three, as it were, Woozles,\nand one, as it was, Wizzle. _Another Woozle has joined them!_\"\n\nAnd so it seemed to be. There we", "re the tracks; crossing over each other\nhere, getting muddled up with each other there; but, quite plainly every\nnow and then, the tracks of four sets of paws.\n\n\"I _think_,\" said Piglet, when he had l", "icked the tip of his nose too,\nand found that it brought very little comfort, \"I _think_ that I have\njust remembered something. I have just remembered something that I\nforgot to do yesterday and shan'", "t be able to do to-morrow. So I suppose\nI really ought to go back and do it now.\"\n\n\"We'll do it this afternoon, and I'll come with you,\" said Pooh.\n\n\"It isn't the sort of thing you can do in the after", "noon,\" said Piglet\nquickly. \"It's a very particular morning thing, that has to be done in\nthe morning, and, if possible, between the hours of----What would you\nsay the time was?\"\n\n\"About twelve,\" said", " Winnie-the-Pooh, looking at the sun.\n\n\"Between, as I was saying, the hours of twelve and twelve five. So,\nreally, dear old Pooh, if you'll excuse me----_What's that?_\"\n\nPooh looked up at the sky, and", " then, as he heard the whistle again, he\nlooked up into the branches of a big oak-tree, and then he saw a friend\nof his.\n\n\"It's Christopher Robin,\" he said.\n\n\"Ah, then you'll be all right,\" said Pigle", "t. \"You'll be quite safe with\n_him_. Good-bye,\" and he trotted off home as quickly as he could, very\nglad to be Out of All Danger again.\n\nChristopher Robin came slowly down his tree.\n\n\"Silly old Bear,", "\" he said, \"what _were_ you doing? First you went round\nthe spinney twice by yourself, and then Piglet ran after you and you\nwent round again together, and then you were just going round a fourth\ntime", "----\"\n\n\"Wait a moment,\" said Winnie-the-Pooh, holding up his paw.\n\nHe sat down and thought, in the most thoughtful way he could think. Then\nhe fitted his paw into one of the Tracks ... and then he scr", "atched his\nnose twice, and stood up.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Winnie-the-Pooh.\n\n\"I see now,\" said Winnie-the-Pooh.\n\n\"I have been Foolish and Deluded,\" said he, \"and I am a Bear of No Brain\nat All.\"\n\n\"You're the B", "est Bear in All the World,\" said Christopher Robin\nsoothingly.\n\n\"Am I?\" said Pooh hopefully.

Sometimes he thought sadly to himself, \"Why?\" and\nsometimes he thought, \"Wherefore?\" and somet", "imes he thought, \"Inasmuch\nas which?\"--and sometimes he didn't quite know what he _was_ thinking\nabout. So when Winnie-the-Pooh came stumping along, Eeyore was very glad\nto be able to stop thinking fo", "r a little, in order to say \"How do you\ndo?\" in a gloomy manner to him.\n\n\"And how are you?\" said Winnie-the-Pooh.\n\nEeyore shook his head from side to side.\n\n\"Not very how,\" he said. \"I don't seem to h", "ave felt at all how for a\nlong time.\"\n\n\"Dear, dear,\" said Pooh, \"I'm sorry about that. Let's have a look at\nyou.\"\n\nSo Eeyore stood there, gazing sadly at the ground, and Winnie-the-Pooh\nwalked all rou", "nd him once.\n\n\"Why, what's happened to your tail?\" he said in surprise.\n\n\"What _has_ happened to it?\" said Eeyore.\n\n\"It isn't there!\"\n\n\"Are you sure?\"\n\n\"Well, either a tail _is_ there or it isn't ther", "e. You can't make a\nmistake about it. And yours _isn't_ there!\"\n\n\"Then what is?\"\n\n\"Nothing.\"\n\n\"Let's have a look,\" said Eeyore, and he turned slowly round to the\nplace where his tail had been a little", " while ago, and then, finding that\nhe couldn't catch it up, he turned round the other way, until he came\nback to where he was at first, and then he put his head down and looked\nbetween his front legs,", " and at last he said, with a long, sad sigh, \"I\nbelieve you're right.\"\n\n\"Of course I'm right,\" said Pooh.\n\n\"That Accounts for a Good Deal,\" said Eeyore gloomily. \"It Explains\nEverything. No Wonder.\"\n\n", "\"You must have left it somewhere,\" said Winnie-the-Pooh.\n\n\"Somebody must have taken it,\" said Eeyore. \"How Like Them,\" he added,\nafter a long silence.\n\nPooh felt that he ought to say something helpful", " about it, but didn't\nquite know what. So he decided to do something helpful instead.\n\n\"Eeyore,\" he said solemnly, \"I, Winnie-the-Pooh, will find your tail for\nyou.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Pooh,\" answered Eeyor", "e. \"You're a real friend,\" said he.\n\"Not like Some,\" he said.\n\nSo Winnie-the-Pooh went off to find Eeyore's tail.\n\nIt was a fine spring morning in the forest as he started out. Little\nsoft clouds play", "ed happily in a blue sky, skipping from time to time in\nfront of the sun as if they had come to put it out, and then sliding\naway suddenly so that the next might have his turn. Through them and\nbetwee", "n them the sun shone bravely; and a copse which had worn its firs\nall the year round seemed old and dowdy now beside the new green lace\nwhich the beeches had put on so prettily. Through copse and spin", "ney\nmarched Bear; down open slopes of gorse and heather, over rocky beds of\nstreams, up steep banks of sandstone into the heather again; and so at\nlast, tired and hungry, to the Hundred Acre Wood. For", " it was in the\nHundred Acre Wood that Owl lived.\n\n\"And if anyone knows anything about anything,\" said Bear to himself,\n\"it's Owl who knows something about something,\" he said, \"or my name's\nnot Winnie", "-the-Pooh,\" he said. \"Which it is,\" he added. \"So there you\nare.\"\n\nOwl lived at The Chestnuts, an old-world residence of great charm, which\nwas grander than anybody else's, or seemed so to Bear, becau", "se it had\nboth a knocker _and_ a bell-pull.

Then, to make quite sure, he knocked and pulled the knocker, and\nhe pulled and knocked the bell-rope, and", " he called out in a very loud\nvoice, \"Owl! I require an answer! It's Bear speaking.\" And the door\nopened, and Owl looked out.\n\n\"Hallo, Pooh,\" he said. \"How's things?\"\n\n\"Terrible and Sad,\" said Pooh, \"", "because Eeyore, who is a friend of mine,\nhas lost his tail. And he's Moping about it.

Did you see them,\nPooh?\"\n\nFor some time now Pooh had been saying \"Yes\" and \"No\" in turn, with his\neyes shut, to all that Owl was sayin", "g, and having said, \"Yes, yes,\" last\ntime, he said \"No, not at all,\" now, without really knowing what Owl was\ntalking about.\n\n\"Didn't you see them?\" said Owl, a little surprised. \"Come and look at\nthe", "m now.\"\n\nSo they went outside. And Pooh looked at the knocker and the notice\nbelow it, and he looked at the bell-rope and the notice below it, and\nthe more he looked at the bell-rope, the more he felt", " that he had seen\nsomething like it, somewhere else, sometime before.\n\n\"Handsome bell-rope, isn't it?\" said Owl.\n\nPooh nodded.\n\n\"It reminds me of something,\" he said, \"but I can't think what. Where\ndi", "d you get it?\"\n\n\"I just came across it in the Forest. It was hanging over a bush, and I\nthought at first somebody lived there, so I rang it, and nothing\nhappened, and then I rang it again very loudly,", " and it came off in my\nhand, and as nobody seemed to want it, I took it home, and----\"\n\n\"Owl,\" said Pooh solemnly, \"you made a mistake.

And, wiping his mouth half an hour\nafterwards, he sang to himself proudly:\n\n    _Who found the Tail?_\n      \"I,\" said Pooh,\n    \"At a quarter to", " two\n      (Only it was quarter to eleven really),\n    _I_ found the Tail!\"\n\n\n\n\n                               CHAPTER V\n\n                    IN WHICH PIGLET MEETS A HEFFALUMP\n\n\nOne day, when Christop", "her Robin and Winnie-the-Pooh and Piglet were\nall talking together, Christopher Robin finished the mouthful he was\neating and said carelessly: \"I saw a Heffalump to-day, Piglet.\"\n\n\"What was it doing?\"", " asked Piglet.\n\n\"Just lumping along,\" said Christopher Robin. \"I don't think it saw\n_me_.\"\n\n\"I saw one once,\" said Piglet. \"At least, I think I did,\" he said. \"Only\nperhaps it wasn't.\"\n\n\"So did I,\" sa", "id Pooh, wondering what a Heffalump was like.\n\n\"You don't often see them,\" said Christopher Robin carelessly.\n\n\"Not now,\" said Piglet.\n\n\"Not at this time of year,\" said Pooh.\n\nThen they all talked abo", "ut something else, until it was time for Pooh\nand Piglet to go home together.

The fact was Piglet was wishing that\n_he_ had thought about it first.\n\n\"I shall do it,\" said Pooh, after waiting a little longer, ", "\"by means of\na trap. And it must be a Cunning Trap, so you will have to help me,\nPiglet.\"\n\n\"Pooh,\" said Piglet, feeling quite happy again now, \"I will.\" And then\nhe said, \"How shall we do it?\" and Poo", "h said, \"That's just it. How?\" And\nthen they sat down together to think it out.\n\nPooh's first idea was that they should dig a Very Deep Pit, and then the\nHeffalump would come along and fall into the P", "it, and----\n\n\"Why?\" said Piglet.\n\n\"Why what?\" said Pooh.\n\n\"Why would he fall in?\"\n\nPooh rubbed his nose with his paw, and said that the Heffalump might be\nwalking along, humming a little song, and loo", "king up at the sky,\nwondering if it would rain, and so he wouldn't see the Very Deep Pit\nuntil he was half-way down, when it would be too late.\n\nPiglet said that this was a very good Trap, but supposi", "ng it were\nraining already?\n\nPooh rubbed his nose again, and said that he hadn't thought of that. And\nthen he brightened up, and said that, if it were raining already, the\nHeffalump would be looking a", "t the sky wondering if it would _clear up_,\nand so he wouldn't see the Very Deep Pit until he was half-way\ndown.... When it would be too late.\n\nPiglet said that, now that this point had been explained", ", he thought it\nwas a Cunning Trap.\n\nPooh was very proud when he heard this, and he felt that the Heffalump\nwas as good as caught already, but there was just one other thing which\nhad to be thought ab", "out, and it was this. _Where should they dig the\nVery Deep Pit?_\n\nPiglet said that the best place would be somewhere where a Heffalump\nwas, just before he fell into it, only about a foot farther on.\n\n", "\"But then he would see us digging it,\" said Pooh.\n\n\"Not if he was looking at the sky.\"\n\n\"He would Suspect,\" said Pooh, \"if he happened to look down.\" He thought\nfor a long time and then added sadly, \"", "It isn't as easy as I thought. I\nsuppose that's why Heffalumps hardly _ever_ get caught.\"\n\n\"That must be it,\" said Piglet.\n\nThey sighed and got up; and when they had taken a few gorse prickles out\nof ", "themselves they sat down again; and all the time Pooh was saying to\nhimself, \"If only I could _think_ of something!\" For he felt sure that a\nVery Clever Brain could catch a Heffalump if only he knew t", "he right way\nto go about it.\n\n\"Suppose,\" he said to Piglet, \"_you_ wanted to catch _me_, how would you\ndo it?\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Piglet, \"I should do it like this. I should make a Trap,\nand I should put a", " Jar of Honey in the Trap, and you would smell it, and\nyou would go in after it, and----\"\n\n\"And I would go in after it,\" said Pooh excitedly, \"only very carefully\nso as not to hurt myself, and I would", " get to the Jar of Honey, and I\nshould lick round the edges first of all, pretending that there wasn't\nany more, you know, and then I should walk away and think about it a\nlittle, and then I should co", "me back and start licking in the middle of\nthe jar, and then----\"\n\n\"Yes, well never mind about that. There you would be, and there I should\ncatch you. Now the first thing to think of is, What do Heffa", "lumps like?\nI should think acorns, shouldn't you? We'll get a lot of----I say, wake\nup, Pooh!\"\n\nPooh, who had gone into a happy dream, woke up with a start, and said\nthat Honey was a much more trappy ", "thing than Haycorns. Piglet didn't\nthink so; and they were just going to argue about it, when Piglet\nremembered that, if they put acorns in the Trap, _he_ would have to find\nthe acorns, but if they pu", "t honey, then Pooh would have to give up some\nof his own honey, so he said, \"All right, honey then,\" just as Pooh\nremembered it too, and was going to say, \"All right, haycorns.\"\n\n\"Honey,\" said Piglet ", "to himself in a thoughtful way, as if it were now\nsettled. \"_I'll_ dig the pit, while _you_ go and get the honey.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" said Pooh, and he stumped off.\n\nAs soon as he got home, he went to the ", "larder; and he stood on a chair,\nand took down a very large jar of honey from the top shelf. It had HUNNY\nwritten on it, but, just to make sure, he took off the paper cover and\nlooked at it, and it _l", "ooked_ just like honey. \"But you never can tell,\"\nsaid Pooh. \"I remember my uncle saying once that he had seen cheese just\nthis colour.\" So he put his tongue in, and took a large lick. \"Yes,\" he\nsaid,", " \"it is. No doubt about that. And honey, I should say, right down\nto the bottom of the jar. Unless, of course,\" he said, \"somebody put\ncheese in at the bottom just for a joke. Perhaps I had better go ", "a\n_little_ further ... just in case ... in case Heffalumps _don't_\nlike cheese ... same as me.... Ah!\" And he gave a deep sigh. \"I\n_was_ right. It _is_ honey, right the way down.\"\n\nHaving made certain", " of this, he took the jar back to Piglet, and Piglet\nlooked up from the bottom of his Very Deep Pit, and said, \"Got it?\" and\nPooh said, \"Yes, but it isn't quite a full jar,\" and he threw it down to\nPi", "glet, and Piglet said, \"No, it isn't! Is that all you've got left?\"\nand Pooh said \"Yes.\" Because it was. So Piglet put the jar at the bottom\nof the Pit, and climbed out, and they went off home togethe", "r.\n\n\"Well, good night, Pooh,\" said Piglet, when they had got to Pooh's\nhouse. \"And we meet at six o'clock to-morrow morning by the Pine Trees,\nand see how many Heffalumps we've got in our Trap.\"\n\n\"Six", " o'clock, Piglet. And have you got any string?\"\n\n\"No. Why do you want string?\"\n\n\"To lead them home with.\"\n\n\"Oh! ... I _think_ Heffalumps come if you whistle.\"\n\n\"Some do and some don't. You never can t", "ell with Heffalumps. Well, good\nnight!\"\n\n\"Good night!\"\n\nAnd off Piglet trotted to his house TRESPASSERS W, while Pooh made his\npreparations for bed.\n\nSome hours later, just as the night was beginning ", "to steal away, Pooh\nwoke up suddenly with a sinking feeling. He had had that sinking feeling\nbefore, and he knew what it meant. _He was hungry._ So he went to the\nlarder, and he stood on a chair and r", "eached up to the top shelf, and\nfound--nothing.\n\n\"That's funny,\" he thought. \"I know I had a jar of honey there. A full\njar, full of honey right up to the top, and it had HUNNY written on it,\nso that ", "I should know it was honey. That's very funny.\" And then he\nbegan to wander up and down, wondering where it was and murmuring a\nmurmur to himself. Like this:\n\n    It's very, very funny,\n    'Cos I _kn", "ow_ I had some honey;\n    'Cos it had a label on,\n            Saying HUNNY.\n    A goloptious full-up pot too,\n    And I don't know where it's got to,\n    No, I don't know where it's gone--\n           ", " Well, it's funny.\n\nHe had murmured this to himself three times in a singing sort of way,\nwhen suddenly he remembered. He had put it into the Cunning Trap to\ncatch the Heffalump.\n\n\"Bother!\" said Pooh.", " \"It all comes of trying to be kind to Heffalumps.\"\nAnd he got back into bed.\n\nBut he couldn't sleep. The more he tried to sleep, the more he couldn't.\nHe tried Counting Sheep, which is sometimes a go", "od way of getting to\nsleep, and, as that was no good, he tried counting Heffalumps. And that\nwas worse. Because every Heffalump that he counted was making straight\nfor a pot of Pooh's honey, _and eati", "ng it all_. For some minutes he lay\nthere miserably, but when the five hundred and eighty-seventh Heffalump\nwas licking its jaws, and saying to itself, \"Very good honey this, I\ndon't know when I've ta", "sted better,\" Pooh could bear it no longer. He\njumped out of bed, he ran out of the house, and he ran straight to the\nSix Pine Trees.\n\nThe Sun was still in bed, but there was a lightness in the sky ov", "er the\nHundred Acre Wood which seemed to show that it was waking up and would\nsoon be kicking off the clothes. In the half-light the Pine Trees looked\ncold and lonely, and the Very Deep Pit seemed dee", "per than it was, and\nPooh's jar of honey at the bottom was something mysterious, a shape and\nno more. But as he got nearer to it his nose told him that it was indeed\nhoney, and his tongue came out and", " began to polish up his mouth, ready\nfor it.\n\n\"Bother!\" said Pooh, as he got his nose inside the jar. \"A Heffalump has\nbeen eating it!\" And then he thought a little and said, \"Oh, no, _I_\ndid. I forgo", "t.\"\n\nIndeed, he had eaten most of it. But there was a little left at the very\nbottom of the jar, and he pushed his head right in, and began to\nlick....\n\nBy and by Piglet woke up. As soon as he woke he", " said to himself, \"Oh!\"\nThen he said bravely, \"Yes,\" and then, still more bravely, \"Quite so.\"\nBut he didn't feel very brave, for the word which was really jiggeting\nabout in his brain was \"Heffalumps", ".\"\n\nWhat was a Heffalump like?\n\nWas it Fierce?\n\n_Did_ it come when you whistled? And _how_ did it come?\n\nWas it Fond of Pigs at all?\n\nIf it was Fond of Pigs, did it make any difference _what sort of P", "ig_?\n\nSupposing it was Fierce with Pigs, would it make any difference _if the\nPig had a grandfather called TRESPASSERS WILLIAM_?\n\nHe didn't know the answer to any of these questions ... and he was\ngoi", "ng to see his first Heffalump in about an hour from now!\n\nOf course Pooh would be with him, and it was much more Friendly with\ntwo. But suppose Heffalumps were Very Fierce with Pigs _and_ Bears?\nWould", "n't it be better to pretend that he had a headache, and couldn't go\nup to the Six Pine Trees this morning? But then suppose that it was a\nvery fine day, and there was no Heffalump in the trap, here he", " would be,\nin bed all the morning, simply wasting his time for nothing. What should\nhe do?\n\nAnd then he had a Clever Idea. He would go up very quietly to the Six\nPine Trees now, peep very cautiously i", "nto the Trap, and see if there\n_was_ a Heffalump there. And if there was, he would go back to bed, and\nif there wasn't, he wouldn't.\n\nSo off he went. At first he thought that there wouldn't be a Heffa", "lump\nin the Trap, and then he thought that there would, and as he got nearer\nhe was _sure_ that there would, because he could hear it heffalumping\nabout it like anything.\n\n\"Oh, dear, oh, dear, oh, dea", "r!\" said Piglet to himself. And he wanted to\nrun away. But somehow, having got so near, he felt that he must just see\nwhat a Heffalump was like. So he crept to the side of the Trap and\nlooked in....\n\n", "And all the time Winnie-the-Pooh had been trying to get the honey-jar\noff his head. The more he shook it, the more tightly it stuck.\n\n\"_Bother!_\" he said, inside the jar, and \"_Oh, help!_\" and, mostly", ",\n\"_Ow!_\" And he tried bumping it against things, but as he couldn't see\nwhat he was bumping it against, it didn't help him; and he tried to\nclimb out of the Trap, but as he could see nothing but jar,", " and not much\nof that, he couldn't find his way. So at last he lifted up his head, jar\nand all, and made a loud, roaring noise of Sadness and Despair ... and\nit was at that moment that Piglet looked d", "own.\n\n\"Help, help!\" cried Piglet, \"a Heffalump, a Horrible Heffalump!\" and he\nscampered off as hard as he could, still crying out, \"Help, help, a\nHerrible Hoffalump! Hoff, Hoff, a Hellible Horralump! ", "Holl, Holl, a\nHoffable Hellerump!\" And he didn't stop crying and scampering until he\ngot to Christopher Robin's house.\n\n\"Whatever's the matter, Piglet?\" said Christopher Robin, who was just\ngetting up", ".\n\n\"Heff,\" said Piglet, breathing so hard that he could hardly speak, \"a\nHeff--a Heff--a Heffalump.\"\n\n\"Where?\"\n\n\"Up there,\" said Piglet, waving his paw.\n\n\"What did it look like?\"\n\n\"Like--like----It ha", "d the biggest head you ever saw, Christopher Robin.\nA great enormous thing, like--like nothing. A huge big--well, like a--I\ndon't know--like an enormous big nothing. Like a jar.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Christo", "pher Robin, putting on his shoes, \"I shall go and\nlook at it. Come on.\"\n\nPiglet wasn't afraid if he had Christopher Robin with him, so off they\nwent....\n\n\"I can hear it, can't you?\" said Piglet anxiou", "sly, as they got near.\n\n\"I can hear _something_,\" said Christopher Robin.\n\nIt was Pooh bumping his head against a tree-root he had found.\n\n\"There!\" said Piglet. \"Isn't it _awful_?\" And he held on tigh", "t to\nChristopher Robin's hand.\n\nSuddenly Christopher Robin began to laugh ... and he laughed ... and he\nlaughed ... and he laughed. And while he was still laughing--_Crash_\nwent the Heffalump's head a", "gainst the tree-root, Smash went the jar,\nand out came Pooh's head again....\n\nThen Piglet saw what a Foolish Piglet he had been, and he was so ashamed\nof himself that he ran straight off home and went", " to bed with a\nheadache. But Christopher Robin and Pooh went home to breakfast\ntogether.\n\n\"Oh, Bear!\" said Christopher Robin. \"How I do love you!\"\n\n\"So do I,\" said Pooh.\n\n\n\n\n                          ", "     CHAPTER VI\n\n                     IN WHICH EEYORE HAS A BIRTHDAY\n                          AND GETS TWO PRESENTS\n\n\nEeyore, the old grey Donkey, stood by the side of the stream, and\nlooked at himse", "lf in the water.\n\n\"Pathetic,\" he said. \"That's what it is. Pathetic.\"\n\nHe turned and walked slowly down the stream for twenty yards, splashed\nacross it, and walked slowly back on the other side. Then ", "he looked at\nhimself in the water again.\n\n\"As I thought,\" he said. \"No better from _this_ side. But nobody minds.\nNobody cares. Pathetic, that's what it is.\"\n\nThere was a crackling noise in the bracke", "n behind him, and out came\nPooh.\n\n\"Good morning, Eeyore,\" said Pooh.\n\n\"Good morning, Pooh Bear,\" said Eeyore gloomily. \"If it _is_ a good\nmorning,\" he said. \"Which I doubt,\" said he.\n\n\"Why, what's the", " matter?\"\n\n\"Nothing, Pooh Bear, nothing. We can't all, and some of us don't. That's\nall there is to it.\"\n\n\"Can't all _what_?\" said Pooh, rubbing his nose.\n\n\"Gaiety. Song-and-dance. Here we go round th", "e mulberry bush.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" said Pooh. He thought for a long time, and then asked, \"What\nmulberry bush is that?\"\n\n\"Bon-hommy,\" went on Eeyore gloomily. \"French word meaning bonhommy,\" he\nexplained. \"I'm ", "not complaining, but There It Is.\"\n\nPooh sat down on a large stone, and tried to think this out. It sounded\nto him like a riddle, and he was never much good at riddles, being a\nBear of Very Little Bra", "in. So he sang _Cottleston Pie_ instead:\n\n    Cottleston, Cottleston, Cottleston Pie,\n    A fly can't bird, but a bird can fly.\n    Ask me a riddle and I reply:\n    \"_Cottleston, Cottleston, Cottlesto", "n Pie._\"\n\nThat was the first verse. When he had finished it, Eeyore didn't\nactually say that he didn't like it, so Pooh very kindly sang the second\nverse to him:\n\n    Cottleston, Cottleston, Cottlesto", "n Pie,\n    A fish can't whistle and neither can I.\n    Ask me a riddle and I reply:\n    \"_Cottleston, Cottleston, Cottleston Pie_.\"\n\nEeyore still said nothing at all, so Pooh hummed the third verse qu", "ietly\nto himself:\n\n    Cottleston, Cottleston, Cottleston Pie,\n    Why does a chicken, I don't know why.\n    Ask me a riddle and I reply:\n    \"_Cottleston, Cottleston, Cottleston Pie_.\"\n\n\"That's right", ",\" said Eeyore. \"Sing.

Why should I be sad? It's my birthday. The happiest day of the\nyear.\"\n\n\"Your birthday?\" said Pooh in great surprise.\n\n\"Of course it is. Can't you see? Look at all th", "e presents I have had.\"\nHe waved a foot from side to side. \"Look at the birthday cake. Candles\nand pink sugar.\"\n\nPooh looked--first to the right and then to the left.\n\n\"Presents?\" said Pooh. \"Birthday", " cake?\" said Pooh. \"_Where?_\"\n\n\"Can't you see them?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Pooh.\n\n\"Neither can I,\" said Eeyore. \"Joke,\" he explained. \"Ha ha!\"\n\nPooh scratched his head, being a little puzzled by all this.\n\n\"But", " is it really your birthday?\" he asked.\n\n\"It is.\"\n\n\"Oh! Well, Many happy returns of the day, Eeyore.\"\n\n\"And many happy returns to you, Pooh Bear.\"\n\n\"But it isn't _my_ birthday.\"\n\n\"No, it's mine.\"\n\n\"Bu", "t you said 'Many happy returns'----\"\n\n\"Well, why not? You don't always want to be miserable on my birthday, do\nyou?\"\n\n\"Oh, I see,\" said Pooh.\n\n\"It's bad enough,\" said Eeyore, almost breaking down, \"be", "ing miserable\nmyself, what with no presents and no cake and no candles, and no proper\nnotice taken of me at all, but if everybody else is going to be\nmiserable too----\"\n\nThis was too much for Pooh. \"S", "tay there!\" he called to Eeyore, as he\nturned and hurried back home as quick as he could; for he felt that he\nmust get poor Eeyore a present of _some_ sort at once, and he could\nalways think of a prop", "er one afterwards.\n\nOutside his house he found Piglet, jumping up and down trying to reach\nthe knocker.\n\n\"Hallo, Piglet,\" he said.\n\n\"Hallo, Pooh,\" said Piglet.\n\n\"What are _you_ trying to do?\"\n\n\"I was ", "trying to reach the knocker,\" said Piglet. \"I just came\nround----\"\n\n\"Let me do it for you,\" said Pooh kindly. So he reached up and knocked\nat the door. \"I have just seen Eeyore,\" he began, \"and poor E", "eyore is in\na Very Sad Condition, because it's his birthday, and nobody has taken\nany notice of it, and he's very Gloomy--you know what Eeyore is--and\nthere he was, and----What a long time whoever liv", "es here is answering\nthis door.\" And he knocked again.\n\n\"But Pooh,\" said Piglet, \"it's your own house!\"\n\n\"Oh!\" said Pooh. \"So it is,\" he said. \"Well, let's go in.\"\n\nSo in they went. The first thing Po", "oh did was to go to the cupboard to\nsee if he had quite a small jar of honey left; and he had, so he took it\ndown.\n\n\"I'm giving this to Eeyore,\" he explained, \"as a present. What are _you_\ngoing to gi", "ve?\"\n\n\"Couldn't I give it too?\" said Piglet. \"From both of us?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Pooh. \"That would _not_ be a good plan.\"\n\n\"All right, then, I'll give him a balloon. I've got one left from my\nparty. I'll g", "o and get it now, shall I?\"\n\n\"That, Piglet, is a _very_ good idea. It is just what Eeyore wants to\ncheer him up. Nobody can be uncheered with a balloon.\"\n\nSo off Piglet trotted; and in the other direc", "tion went Pooh, with his\njar of honey.\n\nIt was a warm day, and he had a long way to go. He hadn't gone more than\nhalf-way when a sort of funny feeling began to creep all over him. It\nbegan at the tip ", "of his nose and trickled all through him and out at the\nsoles of his feet. It was just as if somebody inside him were saying,\n\"Now then, Pooh, time for a little something.\"\n\n\"Dear, dear,\" said Pooh, \"", "I didn't know it was as late as that.\" So he\nsat down and took the top off his jar of honey. \"Lucky I brought this\nwith me,\" he thought. \"Many a bear going out on a warm day like this\nwould never have", " thought of bringing a little something with him.\" And\nhe began to eat.\n\n\"Now let me see,\" he thought, as he took his last lick of the inside of\nthe jar, \"where was I going? Ah, yes, Eeyore.\" He got u", "p slowly.\n\nAnd then, suddenly, he remembered. He had eaten Eeyore's birthday\npresent!\n\n\"_Bother!_\" said Pooh. \"What _shall_ I do? I _must_ give him\n_something_.\"\n\nFor a little while he couldn't think ", "of anything. Then he thought:\n\"Well, it's a very nice pot, even if there's no honey in it, and if I\nwashed it clean, and got somebody to write '_A Happy Birthday_' on it,\nEeyore could keep things in i", "t, which might be Useful.\" So, as he was\njust passing the Hundred Acre Wood, he went inside to call on Owl, who\nlived there.\n\n\"Good morning, Owl,\" he said.\n\n\"Good morning, Pooh,\" said Owl.\n\n\"Many happ", "y returns of Eeyore's birthday,\" said Pooh.\n\n\"Oh, is that what it is?\"\n\n\"What are you giving him, Owl?\"\n\n\"What are _you_ giving him, Pooh?\"\n\n\"I'm giving him a Useful Pot to Keep Things In, and I wante", "d to ask\nyou----\"\n\n\"Is this it?\" said Owl, taking it out of Pooh's paw.\n\n\"Yes, and I wanted to ask you----\"\n\n\"Somebody has been keeping honey in it,\" said Owl.\n\n\"You can keep _anything_ in it,\" said P", "ooh earnestly. \"It's Very Useful\nlike that. And I wanted to ask you----\"\n\n\"You ought to write '_A Happy Birthday_' on it.\"\n\n\"_That_ was what I wanted to ask you,\" said Pooh. \"Because my spelling\nis Wo", "bbly. It's good spelling but it Wobbles, and the letters get in the\nwrong places. Would _you_ write 'A Happy Birthday' on it for me?\"\n\n\"It's a nice pot,\" said Owl, looking at it all round. \"Couldn't I", " give\nit too? From both of us?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Pooh. \"That would _not_ be a good plan. Now I'll just wash it\nfirst, and then you can write on it.\"\n\nWell, he washed the pot out, and dried it, while Owl li", "cked the end of\nhis pencil, and wondered how to spell \"birthday.\"\n\n\"Can you read, Pooh?\" he asked a little anxiously. \"There's a notice\nabout knocking and ringing outside my door, which Christopher Ro", "bin\nwrote. Could you read it?\"\n\n\"Christopher Robin told me what it said, and _then_ I could.\"\n\n\"Well, I'll tell you what _this_ says, and then you'll be able to.\"\n\nSo Owl wrote ... and this is what he", " wrote:\n\n                 HIPY PAPY BTHUTHDTH THUTHDA BTHUTHDY.\n\nPooh looked on admiringly.\n\n\"I'm just saying 'A Happy Birthday',\" said Owl carelessly.\n\n\"It's a nice long one,\" said Pooh, very much im", "pressed by it.\n\n\"Well, _actually_, of course, I'm saying 'A Very Happy Birthday with\nlove from Pooh.' Naturally it takes a good deal of pencil to say a long\nthing like that.\"\n\n\"Oh, I see,\" said Pooh.\n", "\nWhile all this was happening, Piglet had gone back to his own house to\nget Eeyore's balloon. He held it very tightly against himself, so that\nit shouldn't blow away, and he ran as fast as he could so", " as to get to\nEeyore before Pooh did; for he thought that he would like to be the\nfirst one to give a present, just as if he had thought of it without\nbeing told by anybody. And running along, and thi", "nking how pleased\nEeyore would be, he didn't look where he was going ... and suddenly he\nput his foot in a rabbit hole, and fell down flat on his face.\n\nBANG!!!???***!!!\n\nPiglet lay there, wondering w", "hat had happened. At first he thought that\nthe whole world had blown up; and then he thought that perhaps only the\nForest part of it had; and then he thought that perhaps only _he_ had,\nand he was now", " alone in the moon or somewhere, and would never see\nChristopher Robin or Pooh or Eeyore again. And then he thought, \"Well,\neven if I'm in the moon, I needn't be face downwards all the time,\" so\nhe go", "t cautiously up and looked about him.\n\nHe was still in the Forest!\n\n\"Well, that's funny,\" he thought. \"I wonder what that bang was.

It began like\nthis:\n\n    \"_Sing Ho! for the life of a Bear._\"\n\nWhen he had got as", " far as this, he scratched his head, and thought to\nhimself \"That's a very good start for a song, but what about the second\nline?\" He tried singing \"Ho,\" two or three times, but it didn't seem to\nhelp", ". \"Perhaps it would be better,\" he thought, \"if I sang Hi for the\nlife of a Bear.\" So he sang it ... but it wasn't. \"Very well, then,\"\nhe said, \"I shall sing that first line twice, and perhaps if I si", "ng it\nvery quickly, I shall find myself singing the third and fourth lines\nbefore I have time to think of them, and that will be a Good Song. Now\nthen:\"\n\n          Sing Ho! for the life of a Bear!\n   ", "       Sing Ho! for the life of a Bear!\n    I don't much mind if it rains or snows,\n    'Cos I've got a lot of honey on my nice new nose,\n    I don't much care if it snows or thaws,\n    'Cos I've got ", "a lot of honey on my nice clean paws!\n          Sing Ho! for a Bear!\n          Sing Ho! for a Pooh!\n    And I'll have a little something in an hour or two!\n\nHe was so pleased with this song that he sa", "ng it all the way to the top\nof the Forest, \"and if I go on singing it much longer,\" he thought, \"it\nwill be time for the little something, and then the last line won't be\ntrue.\" So he turned it into ", "a hum instead.\n\nChristopher Robin was sitting outside his door, putting on his Big\nBoots. As soon as he saw the Big Boots, Pooh knew that an Adventure was\ngoing to happen, and he brushed the honey off", " his nose with the back of\nhis paw, and spruced himself up as well as he could, so as to look Ready\nfor Anything.\n\n\"Good-morning, Christopher Robin,\" he called out.\n\n\"Hallo, Pooh Bear. I can't get thi", "s boot on.\"\n\n\"That's bad,\" said Pooh.\n\n\"Do you think you could very kindly lean against me, 'cos I keep pulling\nso hard that I fall over backwards.\"\n\nPooh sat down, dug his feet into the ground, and p", "ushed hard against\nChristopher Robin's back, and Christopher Robin pushed hard against his,\nand pulled and pulled at his boot until he had got it on.\n\n\"And that's that,\" said Pooh. \"What do we do next", "?\"\n\n\"We are all going on an Expedition,\" said Christopher Robin, as he got\nup and brushed himself. \"Thank you, Pooh.\"\n\n\"Going on an Expotition?\" said Pooh eagerly. \"I don't think I've ever\nbeen on one", " of those. Where are we going to on this Expotition?\"\n\n\"Expedition, silly old Bear. It's got an 'x' in it.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" said Pooh. \"I know.\" But he didn't really.\n\n\"We're going to discover the North Pole.\"", "\n\n\"Oh!\" said Pooh again. \"What _is_ the North Pole?\" he asked.\n\n\"It's just a thing you discover,\" said Christopher Robin carelessly, not\nbeing quite sure himself.\n\n\"Oh! I see,\" said Pooh. \"Are bears a", "ny good at discovering it?\"\n\n\"Of course they are. And Rabbit and Kanga and all of you. It's an\nExpedition. That's what an Expedition means. A long line of everybody.\nYou'd better tell the others to ge", "t ready, while I see if my gun's all\nright. And we must all bring Provisions.\"\n\n\"Bring what?\"\n\n\"Things to eat.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" said Pooh happily. \"I thought you said Provisions. I'll go and\ntell them.\" And he", " stumped off.\n\nThe first person he met was Rabbit.\n\n\"Hallo, Rabbit,\" he said, \"is that you?\"\n\n\"Let's pretend it isn't,\" said Rabbit, \"and see what happens.\"\n\n\"I've got a message for you.\"\n\n\"I'll give ", "it to him.\"\n\n\"We're all going on an Expotition with Christopher Robin!\"\n\n\"What is it when we're on it?\"\n\n\"A sort of boat, I think,\" said Pooh.\n\n\"Oh! that sort.\"\n\n\"Yes. And we're going to discover a Po", "le or something. Or was it a Mole?\nAnyhow we're going to discover it.\"\n\n\"We are, are we?\" said Rabbit.\n\n\"Yes. And we've got to bring Pro--things to eat with us. In case we want\nto eat them. Now I'm go", "ing down to Piglet's. Tell Kanga, will you?\"\n\nHe left Rabbit and hurried down to Piglet's house. The Piglet was\nsitting on the ground at the door of his house blowing happily at a\ndandelion, and wonde", "ring whether it would be this year, next year,\nsometime or never. He had just discovered that it would be never, and\nwas trying to remember what \"_it_\" was, and hoping it wasn't anything\nnice, when Po", "oh came up.\n\n\"Oh! Piglet,\" said Pooh excitedly, \"we're going on an Expotition, all of\nus, with things to eat. To discover something.\"\n\n\"To discover what?\" said Piglet anxiously.\n\n\"Oh! just something.\"", "\n\n\"Nothing fierce?\"\n\n\"Christopher Robin didn't say anything about fierce. He just said it had\nan 'x'.\"\n\n\"It isn't their necks I mind,\" said Piglet earnestly. \"It's their teeth.\nBut if Christopher Robi", "n is coming I don't mind anything.\"\n\nIn a little while they were all ready at the top of the Forest, and the\nExpotition started. First came Christopher Robin and Rabbit, then Piglet\nand Pooh; then Kan", "ga, with Roo in her pocket, and Owl; then Eeyore; and,\nat the end, in a long line, all Rabbit's friends-and-relations.\n\n\"I didn't ask them,\" explained Rabbit carelessly. \"They just came. They\nalways d", "o. They can march at the end, after Eeyore.\"\n\n\"What I say,\" said Eeyore, \"is that it's unsettling. I didn't want to\ncome on this Expo--what Pooh said. I only came to oblige. But here I\nam; and if I am", " the end of the Expo--what we're talking about--then\nlet me _be_ the end. But if, every time I want to sit down for a\nlittle rest, I have to brush away half a dozen of Rabbit's smaller\nfriends-and-rel", "ations first, then this isn't an Expo--whatever it\nis--at all, it's simply a Confused Noise. That's what _I_ say.\"\n\n\"I see what Eeyore means,\" said Owl. \"If you ask me----\"\n\n\"I'm not asking anybody,\" ", "said Eeyore. \"I'm just telling everybody. We\ncan look for the North Pole, or we can play 'Here we go gathering Nuts\nand May' with the end part of an ant's nest. It's all the same to me.\"\n\nThere was a ", "shout from the top of the line.\n\n\"Come on!\" called Christopher Robin.\n\n\"Come on!\" called Pooh and Piglet.\n\n\"Come on!\" called Owl.\n\n\"We're starting,\" said Rabbit. \"I must go.\" And he hurried off to the", "\nfront of the Expotition with Christopher Robin.\n\n\"All right,\" said Eeyore. \"We're going. Only Don't Blame Me.\"\n\nSo off they all went to discover the Pole. And as they walked, they\nchattered to each o", "ther of this and that, all except Pooh, who was\nmaking up a song.\n\n\"This is the first verse,\" he said to Piglet, when he was ready with it.\n\n\"First verse of what?\"\n\n\"My song.\"\n\n\"What song?\"\n\n\"This one", ".\"\n\n\"Which one?\"\n\n\"Well, if you listen, Piglet, you'll hear it.\"\n\n\"How do you know I'm not listening?\"\n\nPooh couldn't answer that one, so he began to sing.\n\n    They all went off to discover the Pole,", "\n      Owl and Piglet and Rabbit and all;\n    It's a Thing you Discover, as I've been tole\n      By Owl and Piglet and Rabbit and all.\n    Eeyore, Christopher Robin and Pooh\n    And Rabbit's relations", " all went too--\n    And where the Pole was none of them knew....\n      Sing Hey! for Owl and Rabbit and all!\n\n\"Hush!\" said Christopher Robin turning round to Pooh, \"we're just coming\nto a Dangerous Pl", "ace.\"\n\n\"Hush!\" said Pooh turning round quickly to Piglet.\n\n\"Hush!\" said Piglet to Kanga.\n\n\"Hush!\" said Kanga to Owl, while Roo said \"Hush!\" several times to\nhimself very quietly.\n\n\"Hush!\" said Owl to ", "Eeyore.\n\n\"_Hush!_\" said Eeyore in a terrible voice to all Rabbit's\nfriends-and-relations, and \"Hush!\" they said hastily to each other all\ndown the line, until it got to the last one of all. And the la", "st and\nsmallest friend-and-relation was so upset to find that the whole\nExpotition was saying \"Hush!\" to _him_, that he buried himself head\ndownwards in a crack in the ground, and stayed there for two", " days until\nthe danger was over, and then went home in a great hurry, and lived\nquietly with his Aunt ever-afterwards. His name was Alexander Beetle.\n\nThey had come to a stream which twisted and tumbl", "ed between high rocky\nbanks, and Christopher Robin saw at once how dangerous it was.\n\n\"It's just the place,\" he explained, \"for an Ambush.\"\n\n\"What sort of bush?\" whispered Pooh to Piglet. \"A gorse-bus", "h?\"\n\n\"My dear Pooh,\" said Owl in his superior way, \"don't you know what an\nAmbush is?\"\n\n\"Owl,\" said Piglet, looking round at him severely, \"Pooh's whisper was a\nperfectly private whisper, and there wa", "s no need----\"\n\n\"An Ambush,\" said Owl, \"is a sort of Surprise.\"\n\n\"So is a gorse-bush sometimes,\" said Pooh.\n\n\"An Ambush, as I was about to explain to Pooh,\" said Piglet, \"is a sort\nof Surprise.\"\n\n\"If ", "people jump out at you suddenly, that's an Ambush,\" said Owl.\n\n\"It's an Ambush, Pooh, when people jump at you suddenly,\" explained\nPiglet.\n\nPooh, who now knew what an Ambush was, said that a gorse-bus", "h had sprung\nat him suddenly one day when he fell off a tree, and he had taken six\ndays to get all the prickles out of himself.\n\n\"We are not _talking_ about gorse-bushes,\" said Owl a little crossly.\n\n", "\"I am,\" said Pooh.\n\nThey were climbing very cautiously up the stream now, going from rock to\nrock, and after they had gone a little way they came to a place where\nthe banks widened out at each side, s", "o that on each side of the water\nthere was a level strip of grass on which they could sit down and rest.\nAs soon as he saw this, Christopher Robin called \"Halt!\" and they all\nsat down and rested.\n\n\"I ", "think,\" said Christopher Robin, \"that we ought to eat all our\nProvisions now, so that we shan't have so much to carry.\"\n\n\"Eat all our what?\" said Pooh.\n\n\"All that we've brought,\" said Piglet, getting ", "to work.\n\n\"That's a good idea,\" said Pooh, and he got to work too.\n\n\"Have you all got something?\" asked Christopher Robin with his mouth\nfull.\n\n\"All except me,\" said Eeyore. \"As Usual.\" He looked roun", "d at them in his\nmelancholy way. \"I suppose none of you are sitting on a thistle by any\nchance?\"\n\n\"I believe I am,\" said Pooh. \"Ow!\" He got up, and looked behind him.\n\"Yes, I was. I thought so.\"\n\n\"Tha", "nk you, Pooh. If you've quite finished with it.\" He moved across to\nPooh's place, and began to eat.\n\n\"It don't do them any Good, you know, sitting on them,\" he went on, as\nhe looked up munching. \"Take", "s all the Life out of them. Remember that\nanother time, all of you. A little Consideration, a little Thought for\nOthers, makes all the difference.\"\n\nAs soon as he had finished his lunch Christopher Ro", "bin whispered to\nRabbit, and Rabbit said \"Yes, yes, of course,\" and they walked a little\nway up the stream together.\n\n\"I didn't want the others to hear,\" said Christopher Robin.\n\n\"Quite so,\" said Rabb", "it, looking important.\n\n\"It's--I wondered--It's only--Rabbit, I suppose _you_ don't know, What\ndoes the North Pole _look_ like?\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Rabbit, stroking his whiskers. \"Now you're asking me.\"\n\n\"", "I did know once, only I've sort of forgotten,\" said Christopher Robin\ncarelessly.\n\n\"It's a funny thing,\" said Rabbit, \"but I've sort of forgotten too,\nalthough I did know _once_.\"\n\n\"I suppose it's jus", "t a pole stuck in the ground?\"\n\n\"Sure to be a pole,\" said Rabbit, \"because of calling it a pole, and if\nit's a pole, well, I should think it would be sticking in the ground,\nshouldn't you, because the", "re'd be nowhere else to stick it.\"\n\n\"Yes, that's what I thought.\"\n\n\"The only thing,\" said Rabbit, \"is, _where is it sticking_?\"\n\n\"That's what we're looking for,\" said Christopher Robin.\n\nThey went bac", "k to the others. Piglet was lying on his back, sleeping\npeacefully. Roo was washing his face and paws in the stream, while Kanga\nexplained to everybody proudly that this was the first time he had ever", "\nwashed his face himself, and Owl was telling Kanga an Interesting\nAnecdote full of long words like Encyclop\u221a\u00b6dia and Rhododendron to which\nKanga wasn't listening.\n\n\"I don't hold with all this washing", ",\" grumbled Eeyore. \"This modern\nBehind-the-ears nonsense. What do _you_ think, Pooh?\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Pooh, \"_I_ think----\"\n\nBut we shall never know what Pooh thought, for there came a sudden\nsqueak fr", "om Roo, a splash, and a loud cry of alarm from Kanga.\n\n\"So much for _washing_,\" said Eeyore.\n\n\"Roo's fallen in!\" cried Rabbit, and he and Christopher Robin came\nrushing down to the rescue.\n\n\"Look at m", "e swimming!\" squeaked Roo from the middle of his pool, and was\nhurried down a waterfall into the next pool.\n\n\"Are you all right, Roo dear?\" called Kanga anxiously.\n\n\"Yes!\" said Roo. \"Look at me sw----", "\" and down he went over the next\nwaterfall into another pool.\n\nEverybody was doing something to help. Piglet, wide awake suddenly, was\njumping up and down and making \"Oo, I say\" noises; Owl was explai", "ning\nthat in a case of Sudden and Temporary Immersion the Important Thing was\nto keep the Head Above Water; Kanga was jumping along the bank, saying\n\"Are you _sure_ you're all right, Roo dear?\" to whi", "ch Roo, from whatever\npool he was in at the moment, was answering \"Look at me swimming!\"\nEeyore had turned round and hung his tail over the first pool into which\nRoo fell, and with his back to the acc", "ident was grumbling quietly to\nhimself, and saying, \"All this washing; but catch on to my tail, little\nRoo, and you'll be all right\"; and, Christopher Robin and Rabbit came\nhurrying past Eeyore, and w", "ere calling out to the others in front of\nthem.\n\n\"All right, Roo, I'm coming,\" called Christopher Robin.\n\n\"Get something across the stream lower down, some of you fellows,\"\ncalled Rabbit.\n\nBut Pooh wa", "s getting something. Two pools below Roo he was standing with\na long pole in his paws, and Kanga came up and took one end of it, and\nbetween them they held it across the lower part of the pool; and Ro", "o,\nstill bubbling proudly, \"Look at me swimming,\" drifted up against it,\nand climbed out.\n\n\"Did you see me swimming?\" squeaked Roo excitedly, while Kanga scolded\nhim and rubbed him down. \"Pooh, did yo", "u see me swimming? That's called\nswimming, what I was doing. Rabbit, did you see what I was doing?\nSwimming. Hallo, Piglet! I say, Piglet! What do you think I was doing!\nSwimming! Christopher Robin, d", "id you see me----\"\n\nBut Christopher Robin wasn't listening. He was looking at Pooh.\n\n\"Pooh,\" he said, \"where did you find that pole?\"\n\nPooh looked at the pole in his hands.\n\n\"I just found it,\" he said", ". \"I thought it ought to be useful. I just\npicked it up.\"\n\n\"Pooh,\" said Christopher Robin solemnly, \"the Expedition is over. You\nhave found the North Pole!\"\n\n\"Oh!\" said Pooh.\n\nEeyore was sitting with ", "his tail in the water when they all got back to\nhim.\n\n\"Tell Roo to be quick, somebody,\" he said. \"My tail's getting cold. I\ndon't want to mention it, but I just mention it. I don't want to\ncomplain bu", "t there it is. My tail's cold.\"\n\n\"Here I am!\" squeaked Roo.\n\n\"Oh, there you are.\"\n\n\"Did you see me swimming?\"\n\nEeyore took his tail out of the water, and swished it from side to side.\n\n\"As I expected,", "\" he said. \"Lost all feeling. Numbed it. That's what it's\ndone. Numbed it. Well, as long as nobody minds, I suppose it's all\nright.\"\n\n\"Poor old Eeyore. I'll dry it for you,\" said Christopher Robin, an", "d he\ntook out his handkerchief and rubbed it up.\n\n\"Thank you, Christopher Robin. You're the only one who seems to\nunderstand about tails. They don't think--that's what the matter with\nsome of these ot", "hers. They've no imagination. A tail isn't a tail to\n_them_, it's just a Little Bit Extra at the back.\"\n\n\"Never mind, Eeyore,\" said Christopher Robin, rubbing his hardest. \"Is\n_that_ better?\"\n\n\"It's f", "eeling more like a tail perhaps. It Belongs again, if you know\nwhat I mean.\"\n\n\"Hullo, Eeyore,\" said Pooh, coming up to them with his pole.\n\n\"Hullo, Pooh. Thank you for asking, but I shall be able to u", "se it again\nin a day or two.\"\n\n\"Use what?\" said Pooh.\n\n\"What we are talking about.\"\n\n\"I wasn't talking about anything,\" said Pooh, looking puzzled.\n\n\"My mistake again. I thought you were saying how so", "rry you were about my\ntail, being all numb, and could you do anything to help?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Pooh. \"That wasn't me,\" he said. He thought for a little and\nthen suggested helpfully, \"Perhaps it was someb", "ody else.\"\n\n\"Well, thank him for me when you see him.\"\n\nPooh looked anxiously at Christopher Robin.\n\n\"Pooh's found the North Pole,\" said Christopher Robin. \"Isn't that\nlovely?\"\n\nPooh looked modestly d", "own.\n\n\"Is that it?\" said Eeyore.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Christopher Robin.\n\n\"Is that what we were looking for?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Pooh.\n\n\"Oh!\" said Eeyore. \"Well, anyhow--it didn't rain,\" he said.\n\nThey stuck the po", "le in the ground, and Christopher Robin tied a message\non to it.\n\n                               NORTH POLE\n\n                           DISCOVERED BY POOH\n\n                             POOH FOUND IT.\n", "\nThen they all went home again.

Piglet told himself that never\nin all his life, and _he_ was goodness knows _how_ old--three, was it,\nor four?--never had he seen so much rain. Days and days and days.\n\n\"I", "f only,\" he thought, as he looked out of the window, \"I had been in\nPooh's house, or Christopher Robin's house, or Rabbit's house when it\nbegan to rain, then I should have had Company all this time, i", "nstead of\nbeing here all alone, with nothing to do except wonder when it will\nstop.\" And he imagined himself with Pooh, saying, \"Did you ever see such\nrain, Pooh?\" and Pooh saying, \"Isn't it _awful_, ", "Piglet?\" and Piglet\nsaying, \"I wonder how it is over Christopher Robin's way\" and Pooh\nsaying, \"I should think poor old Rabbit is about flooded out by this\ntime.\" It would have been jolly to talk like", " this, and really, it wasn't\nmuch good having anything exciting like floods, if you couldn't share\nthem with somebody.\n\nFor it was rather exciting. The little dry ditches in which Piglet had\nnosed abo", "ut so often had become streams, the little streams across which\nhe had splashed were rivers, and the river, between whose steep banks\nthey had played so happily, had sprawled out of its own bed and wa", "s\ntaking up so much room everywhere, that Piglet was beginning to wonder\nwhether it would be coming into _his_ bed soon.\n\n\"It's a little Anxious,\" he said to himself, \"to be a Very Small Animal\nEntire", "ly Surrounded by Water. Christopher Robin and Pooh could escape by\nClimbing Trees, and Kanga could escape by Jumping, and Rabbit could\nescape by Burrowing, and Owl could escape by Flying, and Eeyore c", "ould\nescape by--by Making a Loud Noise Until Rescued, and here am I,\nsurrounded by water and I can't do _anything_.\"\n\nIt went on raining, and every day the water got a little higher, until\nnow it was ", "nearly up to Piglet's window ... and still he hadn't done\nanything.\n\n\"There's Pooh,\" he thought to himself. \"Pooh hasn't much Brain, but he\nnever comes to any harm. He does silly things and they turn ", "out right.\nThere's Owl. Owl hasn't exactly got Brain, but he Knows Things. He would\nknow the Right Thing to Do when Surrounded by Water. There's Rabbit. He\nhasn't Learnt in Books, but he can always Th", "ink of a Clever Plan.\nThere's Kanga. She isn't Clever, Kanga isn't, but she would be so\nanxious about Roo that she would do a Good Thing to Do without thinking\nabout It. And then there's Eeyore. And E", "eyore is so miserable anyhow\nthat he wouldn't mind about this. But I wonder what Christopher Robin\nwould do?\"\n\nThen suddenly he remembered a story which Christopher Robin had told him\nabout a man on a", " desert island who had written something in a bottle and\nthrown it in the sea; and Piglet thought that if he wrote something in a\nbottle and threw it in the water, perhaps somebody would come and resc", "ue\n_him_!\n\nHe left the window and began to search his house, all of it that wasn't\nunder water, and at last he found a pencil and a small piece of dry\npaper, and a bottle with a cork to it. And he wro", "te on one side of the\npaper:\n\n                                 HELP!\n                              PIGLET (ME)\n\nand on the other side:\n\n                       IT'S ME PIGLET, HELP HELP.\n\nThen he put t", "he paper in the bottle, and he corked the bottle up as\ntightly as he could, and he leant out of his window as far as he could\nlean without falling in, and he threw the bottle as far as he could\nthrow-", "-_splash!_--and in a little while it bobbed up again on the water;\nand he watched it floating slowly away in the distance, until his eyes\nached with looking, and sometimes he thought it was the bottle", ", and\nsometimes he thought it was just a ripple on the water which he was\nfollowing, and then suddenly he knew that he would never see it again\nand that he had done all that he could do to save himsel", "f.\n\n\"So now,\" he thought, \"somebody else will have to do something, and I\nhope they will do it soon, because if they don't I shall have to swim,\nwhich I can't, so I hope they do it soon.\" And then he ", "gave a very long\nsigh and said, \"I wish Pooh were here.

It rained, a", "nd it rained, and it\nrained, and he slept and he slept and he slept. He had had a tiring day.\nYou remember how he discovered the North Pole; well, he was so proud of\nthis that he asked Christopher Rob", "in if there were any other Poles such\nas a Bear of Little Brain might discover.\n\n\"There's a South Pole,\" said Christopher Robin, \"and I expect there's an\nEast Pole and a West Pole, though people don't", " like talking about them.\"\n\nPooh was very excited when he heard this, and suggested that they should\nhave an Expotition to discover the East Pole, but Christopher Robin had\nthought of something else t", "o do with Kanga; so Pooh went out to discover\nthe East Pole by himself. Whether he discovered it or not, I forget; but\nhe was so tired when he got home that, in the very middle of his supper,\nafter he", " had been eating for little more than half-an-hour, he fell fast\nasleep in his chair, and slept and slept and slept.\n\nThen suddenly he was dreaming. He was at the East Pole, and it was a\nvery cold pol", "e with the coldest sort of snow and ice all over it. He had\nfound a bee-hive to sleep in, but there wasn't room for his legs, so he\nhad left them outside. And Wild Woozles, such as inhabit the East Po", "le,\ncame and nibbled all the fur off his legs to make nests for their Young.\nAnd the more they nibbled, the colder his legs got, until suddenly he\nwoke up with an _Ow!_--and there he was, sitting in h", "is chair with his\nfeet in the water, and water all round him!\n\nHe splashed to his door and looked out....\n\n\"This is Serious,\" said Pooh. \"I must have an Escape.\"\n\nSo he took his largest pot of honey a", "nd escaped with it to a broad\nbranch of his tree, well above the water, and then he climbed down again\nand escaped with another pot ... and when the whole Escape was\nfinished, there was Pooh sitting o", "n his branch, dangling his legs, and\nthere, beside him, were ten pots of honey....\n\nTwo days later, there was Pooh, sitting on his branch, dangling his\nlegs, and there, beside him, were four pots of h", "oney....\n\nThree days later, there was Pooh, sitting on his branch, dangling his\nlegs, and there beside him, was one pot of honey.\n\nFour days later, there was Pooh ...\n\nAnd it was on the morning of the", " fourth day that Piglet's bottle came\nfloating past him, and with one loud cry of \"Honey!\" Pooh plunged into\nthe water, seized the bottle, and struggled back to his tree again.\n\n\"Bother!\" said Pooh, a", "s he opened it. \"All that wet for nothing. What's\nthat bit of paper doing?\"\n\nHe took it out and looked at it.\n\n\"It's a Missage,\" he said to himself, \"that's what it is.
