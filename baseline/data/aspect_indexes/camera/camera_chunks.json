Its as gud as my past phns Asus 6z and Vivo v15pro. Battery ofcourse was the highlight while buying ths phn. I received this phn at 43%. And even after a rigorous 3 hr session of data transfer and apps installation it still holds at 33%. I believe it gonna last 2 days easily wth heavy net usage , mild games and gud 2 hrs of talk time.4. I tried playing 7-8 apps at the same time and it never hanged or lagged despite 50% memory up. Yet to try on heavy games though.6. Its one of the best non chinese phn available in the market for those who r luking for a huge battery wth a decent cam and light gaming purpose.

HahahahaThis meanest monster is performing poorly within 5 min of unboxing. Issue: When you trying connecting through Wi-Fi, on giving correct password, it says \"Incorrect Password\". I have done every troubleshooting step suggested by Samsung Tech support:1. The most irritating thing is how can a company like Samsung mess-up such a basic feature & to the surprise, even the tech support has now run out of troubleshooting solutions. Instead of replacing it with new phone, tech support has now told me to get the hardware fixed from Samsung Service centre. I don't get it why should I take a brand new phone to service center & get it opened. Instead a replacement of this phone should be there, I have not even used it for more than an hour. Last year I ordered an MI phone from Flipkart, the battery was getting drained very fast. Within the next day, the phone was replaced without questions asked. Don't spend your hard-earned money on this phone. Unfortunately, if your phone turns-out to be faulty, then there is a never ending process to take care of issue.",

Pros:1) A11 Bionic Processor is blazing fast and coupled with 3GB ram you will never have any issues with any of the heavy duty tasks you throw at it2) Screen resolution (Super retina HD) and the contrast ratio makes the viewing experience breathtaking3) Got the A1865 model ( iPhone X A1865 uses the Qualcomm MDM9655 Snapdragon X16 LTE modem while the iPhone X A1901 has the Intel XMM 7480 modem) which is better than the A1901 model as A1865 covers more cellular bands (GSM and CDMA networks and frequencies) and the performance of Qualcomm\u2019s chips has always been better than Intel\u2019s. LTE speeds and cellular receptions in case of weak signals also are a shade better than A1901.Cons:1) So recommend having a case around it (preferably a transparent one so that the beauty of the original phone can still be enjoyed!)2) I have to say that battery life is average - a shade better than iPhone 8.3)",
