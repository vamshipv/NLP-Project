Full battery drained in 12 hour with non stop used including youtube, whatsapp Facebook, messaging, etc except game.13. No Carrier aggregation: Using Jio sim in Samsung M51 and realme X2 pro and both contain different net speed in which Samsung giving me 5mbps and realme x2 pro giving me 9-10mbps.14. Camera Zoom quality is not good. When you focus on Sky whole pic turn into blue. i.e saturation level is too much high in this phone (Image attached).16. While watching movie video in this phone or playing video in youtube brightness fluctuate fast too much automatically i.e Adaptive Brightness issue. Super amoled plus display2. Camera quality Good3. 7000 Mah battery4. Till now Ram management is goodTo much hype created every where for this phone and due to this many user like me has purchased this phone but this phone under 25k is really not value for money. There are so many phone below 25k with best facilities as compare to this Samsung m51.Conclusion : Phone is overpriced and performance is average",

It has better specs than A51 which retails around 8-9k than M31s which makes this phone one of a kind. The dimensions are also the same as A51.

I've played PUBG quite a lot on this device and have not noticed any major frame drops at HDR graphics and Extreme frame rates, let alone Smooth graphics. Videos are very stable though. This has come close to the iPhone cameras as a video shooter. This might even offer better stabilization than the iPhone videos. This could be seen while watching Youtube videos in non-fill screen mode or videos that have any kind of frame visible or even games like PUBG where static elements of game like the map's frame or your controls would be visible on certain background colours even after you have turned the game off.",

These software updates will be eventually updated for the 7 Pro as well.==== I'm personally not a fan of notches nor do I click a lot of selfies, so I prefer the OnePlus 7T Pro's Fluid Display. It still uses the Sony IMX 586 (48 MP) for it's main sensor and it's Telephoto at 2.2X optical (3X lossless) and is at par with iPhone. Software ====This is one of the biggest features for you to switch to the OnePlus. Stock Android was butter smooth while I missed out on a lot of simple gestures like Longer Screenshots, Silence Button, Customized Navigational elements & much more which lacked on the Stock OS from Google. I would say Oxygen OS should be set as a benchmark for Google to include these incremental features on their upcoming flagships. Oxygen OS has presently the best OS Experience for Android.==== Battery ====Warp T30 is super fast. ROG 2 is hands down the best gaming phone with 120 HZ Display but lacks majorly on other aspects like software updates, Telephoto Camera, Splash Proof, Build Quality and security patches which are very essential for business professionals or regular consumers. ASUS is also not known to provide regular updates to it's consumers over the OnePlus which has a closely knit community among the developers and has more Brand Value than ASUS & nevertheless to mention that the OnePlus 7T Pro feels premium out of the box. If you're planning to upgrade from a device almost 2 years old then this would be the best upgrade in case you require a phone with no-notch and curved screen. If you still wish to own this but cannot afford the extra rupee on incremental updates (Fast Charging, 855 Plus) , my suggestion would be is to go for the OnePlus 7 Pro.",

I will not speak about the specs as most reviews highlight it in detailwhat I liked!Blazing fast  while opening closing apps etcCamera is quite good! I would not rate it as good as pixel, but produces very acceptable quality in most lighting conditionsdesign is very slim. but I would recommend a case as it is slippery especially while trying to take selfiesVideos are with Electronic image stabilisation ( 4K too) which is brilliant!Dash charge is very good!latest OS 4.5.8 update is available also to downloadwhat I dislikedCamera app is very basic. Battery life is a question mark especially over 2-3 years as currently even with moderate usage It gets me through a day ( but most phones have this problem so its not a deal breaker )Display legibility is not great especially under direct sunlight. this could be corrected with adaptive brightness but then indoors it becomes too bright.so drains the batteryOther than display legibility most of the above cons can be fixed by software updates I guess.",

I mean the pictures are not so bad, but there is definitely some tuning required to make the camera take good shots at night. PROS:--Supports fast charge and has pretty decent charge rates-Has NFC which enables in wireless payments and support for Android Beam (unless Android 10 comes)-Has a good 4000mAh battery, pretty decent for bit of heavy users-Has on-screen fingerprint which is good-Camera setup is goodCONS:--Camera struggles to shoot better pictures at night-The included night mode requires a little bit software upgrade-OneUI which is extremely good, but the icons are kind of kiddish-And mostly- Most of the cons are fixable by latter FOTA upgradesSo if you are looking for a budget option, go for itThis is my review after using the A30s for 3 months. Firstly speaking, samsung claims to have a 4000mAh battery, which sounds good but use it and you will feel that it is not actually keeping the charge for the required hoped time. But despite all of these, samsung strictly gets a plus mark for it's awesome update schedule.",

Doesn't misses out on any feature like reverse wireless charging, 5g support (though in India not of use for at least couple of years), NFC, Dual GPS, capable of being connected to wifi and provide Hotspot simultaneously, No MIUI ads till date. This phone comes with Global MIUI 11 and has Google dialer and messaging app thus misses out features like call recording, phone notes etc. 3. Trust me this MIUI has a lot of bugs and thus results in issues like while using finger print scanner, the device heats up at times even during normal usage, but the overall performance is acceptable. (Hopefully most of the issues will be resolved by MIUI 12 update which is going to be available soon)4. The battery is bigger compared to many devices but looses about 10 to 20% even when left untouched overnight thus I'd say not so good battery management.6. I think that the phone is slightly overpriced at 50k but if we compare it with it`s biggest competitor the One plus 8 I will always choose MI 10 as so many things are missing in One plus 8 (like wireless charging, LP DDR RAM 4x is present instead of 5, comes with smaller battery 4300mAH and Sony IMX 586 Camera sensor which is quite outdated now) and have a price difference of only 5k. However in comparison with One plus 8 pro I feel that MI 10 is slightly behind because of the MIUI bugs related flaws, FHD+ display and outdated secondary camera hardware (including front camera.",

Almost all phones come with these features these days and after adapting to iphones technology, the other phones are going a step ahead, so definitely, apple is the trend setter!
