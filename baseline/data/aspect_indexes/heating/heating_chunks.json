The design actually fits the hand well as it is shorter than usual on breadth, and a bit more on length, all the more better viewing experience.6) Gaming performance is average. (Similar phones in this range have better gaming performances)7) The phone looks and feels premium while using.8) Face Unlock is as fast as other OnePlus phones. 4K video recording @ 60fps is absent but 1080@60fps performance is quite good. The mono speaker is on the bottom right of the phone, which tends to get covered by your hand while using. Also, being on just one side of the phone, the audio isn't as well delivered as it is on a stereo speaker.4) The plastic frame (doesn't look like plastic but it is) is a worrying thing and makes the phone *comparatively* less durable.6) Fingerprint scanner being under the screen isn't as quick as a traditional fingerprint scanner on the back. Recommendation: If you're looking for a phone which delivers high performance and smooth interface for your daily use, go for it. Also, if you're expecting flagship camera performance, you might want to consider other phones.",

The punch hole camera does not spoil the overall screen experience as some people have said. Very sleek and premium looking design-wise. The battery life does not last really long when you use it on 120 Hz QHD+, although it's quite manageable and can get through the day with mid usage easily. Coming to gaming, I'm a hardcore gamer and can game continuously for 3-4 hours, and let me tell you this phone can run through it with ease. I've played PUBG quite a lot on this device and have not noticed any major frame drops at HDR graphics and Extreme frame rates, let alone Smooth graphics. It runs PUBG really smoothly. Stable frames at all times. I would suggest it for competitive PUBG and other games too. The 120 Hz Amoled screen is breathtaking. Buttery smooth at all times. Certainly the best display on a phone. I have found the cameras to be decent enough. Nothing too fancy, nor a let down. Videos are very stable though. This has come close to the iPhone cameras as a video shooter. This might even offer better stabilization than the iPhone videos. The colour filter camera is disabled out of the box. Speakers are fairly loud and clear. A very good surround experience. You'll find a Dolby sample video in your gallery. Play it on the phone speakers and see for yourself. The phone that I had received, I used it for about 2 weeks and discovered it had this image retention issue. The afterimage of anything displayed for a period of time on the phone for a long time is displayed on the screen even after the original image is pulled off. This could be seen while watching Youtube videos in non-fill screen mode or videos that have any kind of frame visible or even games like PUBG where static elements of game like the map's frame or your controls would be visible on certain background colours even after you have turned the game off. I had reset the phone and not seen any kind of improvement. Also, my screen had no green tints. The image retention issue could easily turn into permanent screen burns really soon. Hope you people find this review useful. Not a very organized review but that's what I have experienced.",

    "text": "====I am a Design Specialist by Profession & also into Mobile Photography, hence I was hooked in using the Pixel 2XL. This phone is a worthy upgrade if you're transitioning from Galaxy S9 / Pixel 1 or 2 series / OnePlus 6, 6T & below / iPhone X or 7 and below. OnePlus 7T Pro is only an incremental upgrade over it's predecessor OnePlus 7 Pro.===== What has been improved over the 7 Pro? ====+ Faster Processor. Snapdragon 855 Plus.+ Adreno 640. Better Gaming Performance.+ Better Haptic Motor. Same as the 7T.+ Fast Charging. Warp 30T Technology.+ Brighter Nits (Upto 1000 compared to 800 of 7 Pro)+ Super Macro Mode, Night reading Modes, Android 10 out of the box, Better Nightscape 2.0. These software updates will be eventually updated for the 7 Pro as well.==== ====OnePlus 7T Pro Device. And some cool OnePlus Stickers.==== Display ====Firstly, OnePlus 7T Pro has a stunning display over its predecessors. I'm personally not a fan of notches nor do I click a lot of selfies, so I prefer the OnePlus 7T Pro's Fluid Display. Feels more luxurious over the 7T. However, you should also note that in different lighting conditions, 7T Pro has glares at the curves due to the rounder corners which I believe is negligible. You would never want to get back to 60Hz once you're used to this.==== Performance ====Snapdragon 855 Plus is one of the best CPUs out there (at the time of writing this review) and with Adrena 640, it takes gaming and multi-tasking to another league. Plus is at par with the A13 Bionic from Apple. RAM Management is splendid & 8GB RAM is recommended unless you want to get the 12 Gig McLaren Edition to save on a few seconds everyday.==== Camera ====I honestly have to admit that it's not the best out there as I was expecting a leap from it's predecessors. It still uses the Sony IMX 586 (48 MP) for it's main sensor and it's Telephoto at 2.2X optical (3X lossless) and is at par with iPhone. But when compared with the GCam Mod, the OnePlus Camera seems to have improved a lot from it's previous versions. Apple iPhone 11 takes the lead here. Software ====This is one of the biggest features for you to switch to the OnePlus. Stock Android was butter smooth while I missed out on a lot of simple gestures like Longer Screenshots, Silence Button, Customized Navigational elements & much more which lacked on the Stock OS from Google. I would say Oxygen OS should be set as a benchmark for Google to include these incremental features on their upcoming flagships. Oxygen OS has presently the best OS Experience for Android.==== Battery ====Warp T30 is super fast. It helps you charge from 0-100 in lesser time than an episode on Netflix. Although not the fastest charger in the industry, it still gets through a day on heavy usage.==== What could've been improved ====- Minor improvements on Camera.- No Wireless Charging.- IP Rating.- Better silicon case should be included in their future upgrades.==== Verdict ====No doubt that the ASUS Fans would recommend the ROG 2. ROG 2 is hands down the best gaming phone with 120 HZ Display but lacks majorly on other aspects like software updates, Telephoto Camera, Splash Proof, Build Quality and security patches which are very essential for business professionals or regular consumers. ASUS is also not known to provide regular updates to it's consumers over the OnePlus which has a closely knit community among the developers and has more Brand Value than ASUS & nevertheless to mention that the OnePlus 7T Pro feels premium out of the box. If you're planning to upgrade from a device almost 2 years old then this would be the best upgrade in case you require a phone with no-notch and curved screen. 7T Pro feels very slippery when compared to the 7T. I wish they made smaller devices. Otherwise I would still recommend the 7T which is the best bang for your buck. If you still wish to own this but cannot afford the extra rupee on incremental updates (Fast Charging, 855 Plus) , my suggestion would be is to go for the OnePlus 7 Pro. It's still one of the best devices out there.",

Looks exactly like DSLR clicks. Macro - I love taking closeup shots of flowers and patterns and with this...you can get as close as 2.5 cms and click amazing shots. You get crisp and clear pictures without any noise. Popup camera - If you are hesitant or doubtful about popup cameras...I am telling you there is nothing to worry... It is Soo smooth and quick that you never will notice it is a hardware controlled camera. Selfies have never been this better. Bright and sharp shots anytime. Will update later3)Dolby speakers - Excellent sound quality with awesome stereo effect. Once again a huge upgrade over the older models.4)90 Hz refresh rate - It is clearly faster and better than the usual 60Hz displays.5)Build and design - Just perfect... It's sleek...stylish and neat. And I totally loved the edge display in OnePlus 7 pro. This device is just a perfect combination of the best features in the 7t and the 7pro and NOT an unwanted model like everyone is claiming.6) Batter and charging - The charging is blazing fast and the battery very easily lasts a whole day,even with 90Hz refresh rate.",

Dash Charge: In the fast paced world, the faster the phone charges, the better it is. And the OnePlus\u2019s Dash Charge proves that point beyond a doubt. Just like the OnePlus 3/3T, the OnePlus 5 also comes packed with the mighty Dash Charger. The Dash Charge is capable of charging the phone from 0-60% in just 30 mins and that\u2019s more than impressive.4. OS:The Oxygen OS software has been updated to Oreo in the last week that we have been using it. It adds some light, useful and tasteful customizations on top of stock Android that add value. and it\u2019s impressive how OnePlus can strike the right balance so early in the game. I particularly find gestures (including alternate actions you can assign to navigation keys) and the left home screen pane very helpful.5. Battery And Audio:The 3300mAh battery on the OnePlus 5 can comfortably last for one moderate usage day. The Dash charge is incredibly fast as ever and will prove to be a big convenience. The loudspeaker on the phone is present on the bottom edge. It\u2019s quite average in terms of loudness but the audio quality is reasonable. Audio output via headphones is very good. The call quality on the phone is excellent.

    "text": "After using the all new Samsung Galaxy A30s, i truly found that this is a nice little budget phone for day to day consumers. It has got a decent battery backup, display's amazing (first time using an AMOLED display), the triple camera setup is quite useful and has good color reproduction but it somehow cannot try to get a good shot at night. I mean the pictures are not so bad, but there is definitely some tuning required to make the camera take good shots at night. The fingerprint reader is very fast but be careful to use a certified and original screen guards or protectors as the fingerprint does struggle in screen guards. Included accessories are a pretty decent specially the included fast charger with the Type-C cable pretty sturdy. Overall this phone is a good competitor against chinese manufacturers. PROS:--Supports fast charge and has pretty decent charge rates-Has NFC which enables in wireless payments and support for Android Beam (unless Android 10 comes)-Has a good 4000mAh battery, pretty decent for bit of heavy users-Has on-screen fingerprint which is good-Camera setup is goodCONS:--Camera struggles to shoot better pictures at night-The included night mode requires a little bit software upgrade-OneUI which is extremely good, but the icons are kind of kiddish-And mostly- Where is Bixby voice assistant?There is bixby home though but this phone does not support Bixby voice assistantOverall the cons are not a big factor. Most of the cons are fixable by latter FOTA upgradesSo if you are looking for a budget option, go for itThis is my review after using the A30s for 3 months. Firstly speaking, samsung claims to have a 4000mAh battery, which sounds good but use it and you will feel that it is not actually keeping the charge for the required hoped time. I mean, typically a 4000mAh battery should last for 1 and a half day easily. I had to dip the phone in the charger atleast two to three times a day. And strictly speaking, i don't play heavy games like PUBG or COD. I am just a day to day user. But you cant complain if the phone charges in 45 mins. Another thing i want to mention, please keep a 4D tempered glass screen protector otherwise a single hard drop in that AMOLED screen will cause a good beautiful crack in the screen. Also i feel like the speaker of this phone is not upto the mark. Like, i've used budget phones like realme 3, Asus zenfone max pro m1, Asus max pro m2, redmi 7a. Also, the fingerprint get's slow as you use it. But despite all of these, samsung strictly gets a plus mark for it's awesome update schedule.",

    "text": "This is my 3rd iPhone after iPhone 4S and iPhone 6S Plus. Being an utter working middle class guy, I don't switch my iPhones very often (my android phones barely lasted me 9 months though). I do consider them extremely expensive, and I wouldn't go for one, unless I felt it was worth the money I was paying for it. I got this phone for INR 69,999/- from Amazon. With exchange offer, it cost me a little over 60K. For the price (and that price only), this makes it worth the buy.- It may not be the latest and greatest, but compared to iPhone XR, this is a much better package overall. Considering the XR is now priced higher than X. XS is only marginally better, and didn't feel it was worth the extra 30K.- Even after a year of being on the market, this phone is an absolute beast in terms of performance, especially after iOS 12.- The Camera is a beauty. You can't compare with DSLRs, but it is right up there with OnePlus and Google phones.- Looks exactly like the XS, and doesn't even have the S badging. The phone is extremely slippery. Invest in a good case, front screen protector and a rear glass protector- Such expensive phones should come with 128GB of storage as base, instead of 64GB. If you have the money, go for XS Max.- The battery isn't the best. Takes over two hours to fully charge from 5% to 100% even with the iPad charger. With moderate usage, you can get 8 hours barely.- With the price of the phone, should have at least come with the fast charger in the box.",

Once you will keep the device handy it will give you a feel of it. With the brand tag line of Vivo \u201cCamera & Music\u201d it really impressed me. I\u2019ll surely recommend my fellow buyers to buy this cool device.
