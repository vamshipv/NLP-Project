However, for their improvement, I tried to give some critical feedback to the company over phone but it was not so easy, so, I am writing here sothat Samsung India can take this critical review for their improvement. Battery:Battery is 7K mha but it is draining so fast that its overall backup time is slightly better than any other average phone. In this price segment, Samsung can easily provide metallic back for better appearance and transfer of heat. Overall, its good non chini phone with good camera and display, a bit bulky, satisfactory speed, scope of tremendous improvement in UI and setting, and bit overpriced.",

Battery lasts more than 36hrs (with Bluetooth earphone at times).Charging happened in 70-75 mins with intermediate usage in between. Earphone Jack available comparing to Nord, better than Bluetooth earphone which consumes charge and needs charge for earphones too. Settings - an ocean of settings, wonderful touch sensor and additional features for lock facilities. Audio - Its so good with clear audio in all needs. Photo - Video : Excellent quality of photos and Videos even in a 3x Zoom. Front camera is bit down. Macro Mode is giving a great pic of Close shots. Has Slowmo, Super slowmo, Hyperlapse, Panaroma. AR zone is pure magical. Different features for Front cam and Back cam. Reverse charging facility is amazing. Overall - M31s is a price worthy with sooo many options.

No green tint / black crush issue found on my device. Camera:It is clear that only 3 rear camera are working right now. No color filter is working. It may redeaign and enable later via software update. Rather than every sensor of all camera working fine. Pictures taken by rear camera with all mode is so bright that u can find every details in the pictures.48 MP wide angle camera is take so wide and beautiful pictures. On front camera section it take good bright pictures, but i think in portrait mode it take little bit artistic image than real. Slow-Mo working fine. Macro working fine. Battery:Battery backup is good. 30 W Warp charger  chage the device very fast. 19 hrs before charging and its still 6 hrs left. Screen on time is approx 8 hrs. No wireless charger so dont know about wireless chaging. Oxygen OS:This is my 3rd OP devices and the best part which i love is its Oxygen OS. OnePlus own gestures is also missing this time. Proximity sensor working fine. Pocket mode working fine. Fingerprint sensor is superfast. Face unlock also superfast. Sound & Vibration:Sound is good but i think ring volume is little bit low. Speaker is loud, you can use Dolby Atmos enhancement also. Heptic feedback is low which is good. Network:OP 8 Pro not support our own navigation system NavIC right now. No announcement from OnePlus also. Qualcomm announced that its 865 Snapdragon processor support NavIC system. So dont worry ur hardware support NavIC. Maybe software update comes later.",

The A11 Bionic chip has played an absolute  role in maximising the efficiency of the iPhone 8. As for the battery, it\u2019s always better to turn off the mobile data or Wi-Fi on an iPhone when not in use to make the battery last longer than usual. When it comes to make a choice between an iPhone 8 and an iPhone 8 Plus, I\u2019d personally recommend the 8. The screen size is pretty decent, fits in your pocket well & at the same time the iPhone 8 maintains the essence of an iPhone. However, if you\u2019re into larger phones or photography (Dual Camera & the Portrait Mode), the 8 Plus is a great option. The all-glass panel makes the iPhone 8 a bit heavier than the iPhone 7 however, it adds to the style making the device look more premium. I\u2019m not really into photography so wouldn\u2019t comment about the camera but the iPhone cameras have always been the eye candy for almost everyone.",

I\u2019ll list some pros and cons and also what the tech media won\u2019t tell you. Pros:- battery life is all day- upgraded speakers get real loud- fast and smooth- Siri has been given shortcuts- upgraded cameras are just as good as Samsung cameras now and the front camera is better than the Note 9 front cameraCons:- expensive- slow speed charger- A case is almost mandatory especially if you are clumsyBottom line...the iPhone and Galaxy phones are the best phones on the market right now. The iPhone is a step ahead because iOS gets frequent updates and starting with iOS 12 Apple actually sped up old iPhones and iPads which will allow users to keep their devices longer. An iPhone is now like a laptop and something you only need to upgrade once it breaks. The iPhone is also the ONLY smartphone that can stream all video apps in full screen. Android doesn\u2019t have full screen built into the OS so video apps like HBO, Showtime, Cinemax, STARZ, Encore, and EPIC are all tiny on the Note 9...those apps are all full screen on the iPhone.",
