Camera is going to serve you well on many occasions (when the lighting is good). People might have told you that the camera system is mediocre. There have been few software updates and I can confidently say that yes, the camera is neither great nor is it bad. It delivers decent pictures (when the lighting is good) and if you are not a absolute camera geek, then this will meet and succeed all of your expectations. Incase you are a camera geek, then get the 8Pro and dont think about saving money. Conclusion: Feels expensive and has a nice balance in the hand (Its very light and is a joy to use).

My experience with the device says that most of the reviews or unboxing things are influenced. Pls, note I have bought it with my own money unlike leading reviewers or unboxing video geeks who get it for free. Go for users reviews who bought them with their own money. So I am writing my 5 days experience with the phone. A regular user who wants to do all the office work on the phone, social media, blogging and vlogging, etc. The last OnePlus phone I was using was Oneplus 5 and was quite happy with it until it screen got broken and replacement cost was higher than the selling price of the device itself. I have clicked a magazine cover picture with my Oneplus 5 which had only 16 MP camera but pic quality was natural and good. Battery:  Battery is avg. All those time I teased my iPhone or Samsung Series colleagues and friends for their battery life. This offers an avg battery life. I never carried a charger with me in previous models if I Start with 90% even after two years. I m wondering what would be this phone battery life in a year or more.4. 90 Hz refresh rate is a gimmick to sell this device. It will give you fluid experience but the soon it consumes battery you will always prefer to keep it to 60hz which is an option given in the display settings. If you always stick to a desk or have a power source around you can keep it to 90hz. Not for people who are on the move most of the time. Sound: Phone calls are not crisp and clear. At times the caller's voice gets hazy and husky. Voice is even audible to person the person sitting next to me. Speakers volume is loud but the sound quality is not good.6. With multiple variants, it has joined the league of Samsung, Mi, Oppo, Vivo. Now they are launching 7t pro on Oct 10 again it is a disappointment for those who bought 7t on day 1. Maybe their R&D or trials have some problem here that in every two months they are launching a new device with an update to the previous faults. Like OnePlus 7 has voice receiver on one side which is right. So if you take calls or hear the phone from left you won't get a clear voice or volume. So they added receivers on both the side in this device. No camera quality, no battery life, no sound quality on calls, getting wounds on holding it for long. I have always recommended OnePlus devices to everyone around and had high hopes and trust on the brand that I bought it on the day of the launch but with this experience, I won't recommend OnePlus 7t to my colleagues and friends who are planning to upgrade their devices.",

You would never want to get back to 60Hz once you're used to this.==== Performance ====Snapdragon 855 Plus is one of the best CPUs out there (at the time of writing this review) and with Adrena 640, it takes gaming and multi-tasking to another league. Stock Android was butter smooth while I missed out on a lot of simple gestures like Longer Screenshots, Silence Button, Customized Navigational elements & much more which lacked on the Stock OS from Google. I would say Oxygen OS should be set as a benchmark for Google to include these incremental features on their upcoming flagships. Oxygen OS has presently the best OS Experience for Android.==== Battery ====Warp T30 is super fast. Although not the fastest charger in the industry, it still gets through a day on heavy usage.==== What could've been improved ====- Minor improvements on Camera.- If you still wish to own this but cannot afford the extra rupee on incremental updates (Fast Charging, 855 Plus) , my suggestion would be is to go for the OnePlus 7 Pro.",

    "text": "I am a long time customer of oneplus phones and since last 3 years I have been using oneplus 5 and that phone is as good as new. Here are some of the issues I am facing with the new onplus 8 pro.- Battery - The phone doesn't last one day with full charge. I dont play any games, my phone usage is mainly social media, instagram,facebook,reddit, twitter and bunch of other photo edit tools like lightroom and snapseed. If I charge full and start my day, then by evening 8pm  my phone is battery saver mode. Which is not the case on my oneplus 5 even after 3 years. And its more concerning because I don't use any of the power hungry games or apps. Btw I have removed 120hz refresh rate on the first week itself and all this battery issue is even when I am using it at 60hz refresh rate with default app/battery settings. I bought the oneplus 8 pro selling my DSLR camera so that I can record all my videos on phone itself plus its waterproof. Recently I shot a video at 4k 60fps and I guess within few minutes the phone got so heated that it disabled the camera from video shooting until the phone cooled down!! Now whats the use if I cant record a video even for few minutes straight on 4K?Camera - To be honest, stabilization is really great while recording video however photos are almost as good as oneplus 5 if not slightly better. But nothing that worth paying double the price you pay over oneplus 5. Video clarity is really great, far better than the oneplus 5. Wide angle is the only thing I felt is worth compared to oneplus 5.Apart from the above rest of the things are good I feel. Fingerprint lockscreen works mostly 70% of the time. Overall I regret buying the phone. Even if they had fixed the battery issues, this phone would have been a great choice.",

As per the technician who did visit, agreed that there is lag in theusage but that's OPPO for you and signs off saying he'll have to resolvethe ticket, booking this under working fine.

The high price of iPhone is so justified by the sheer brilliance of camera it has. Sure it is just 12 MP, but the clarity, my o my!Sure the battery is just about 2600 compared to 3500 of a Redmi, but it lasts longer than a Redmi. My last iPhone was a 4S and then since I love buying phones every 6 months, I shifted to Android (Redmi, Samsung, Honor) to satiate my hunger for new phones. All these phones are superb, no doubt, but once you use the iPhone 7, you know that the difference between these phones and iPhone 6s has got much bigger because of the camera. Bottom line, iPhone 7 has jumped a big leap from the 6s and the 8 is almost similar. The X is double the price of a 7, so probably all things taken in account, the iPhone 7 is the best value for money among all phones in India",
