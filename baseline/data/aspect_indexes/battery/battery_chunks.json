Due to something or the other defects (like headache giving screens, line marks at the back of the body, etc) as it's expensive!Phone boxes were puffed, torned, some displays were dull if noticed closely, more warm and yellowish. No control by OnePlus on this. People go nuts like \"wow what a display\" not realizing that they are being given inferior quality displays of Samsung. I hope I really hope people strive for perfection to really understand and get what they are paying for by controlling their excitements a bit and forward stronger feedbacks, as I believe I was listened and Amazon India did helped me too. My 5th device came altogether from a different location, excellent box, phone built and display feels more broader even with same dimensions, no two parallel lines design or defect at the back, it's clean and curvy like OnePlus 8 8gb variant (mine is the 6gb one). Screen display is still more warm which I didn't want but colors are very punchy and clearly shows the display is far better than previous returned devices.1st OnePlus 8 8gb - Had a very long permanent line mark at the back of the body if looked closely.2nd OnePlus 8 8gb - Display's blue light filter had issues I'm sure as it gave me headache in seconds, eye strain as well.3rd OnePlus 8 6gb - 2 parallel lines on edges of the back body if the device was tilted a little, was like a dent kind of design or defect (I believe though this one had the best display even than the 5th one that I'm keeping and more smoother 90 HZ).4th OnePlus 8 6gb - 2 parallel lines were again there so I thought it's normal and was okay with it, but display was yellowish and dull, playing pubg with graphics optimization made the game look more ugly in extreme hd settings (hdr sucks). Looking at Images on articles, etc were looking just good.5th OnePlus 8 6gb variant - As told above there are no 2 parallel lines, punchy colors, not dull and very good display, however still yellowish in large part of the screen and whitish around above and right & left edges of the screen in vivid mode (I did noticed in some displays it was not this warm). I also noticed vivid mode was nicer and whiter in previous devices than this one whether they were dull or not. I also know screen being yellowish a bit makes video viewing an amazing experience to make it more natural for skin color, etc. However, I'm tierd and somewhat satisfied but will want OnePlus to correct if possible with software update without compromising any quality of the display. It's said that Apple never compromises on quality, they even delay their production if they find any imperfections (I don't like iOS or use Apple though). OnePlus should do like this. I noticed paying more (when I got the 8gb one) was really like getting better qalutiy made device (the first one, if the issue mentioned wasn't there). This shouldn't be the case as this leads to disappointment and all variants should be given the same attention/perfection with just internal hardware changes. OnePlus 8 will be my first and last device for a short period of time.",

Very difficult to use with one hand.- Fingerprint scanner and Face unlocks works like a charm.- Design is great and the available color options are different and awesome.- Earpiece volume during calls are not the greatest but adequate. OP3 earpiece volume had deteriorated very much over time.- Rear Camera has improved a lot, but I can already feel that there are still rooms for improvement. Also, watch YT videos in landscape mode.- Lack of the 3.5mm headphone jack is the biggest let down for me in this phone. The Ultramarine Blue is fantastic \ud83d\ude0d.Finally, if the price is not a deal breaker, then I *Highly Recommend* this \"Flagship\" phone from OnePlus.",

Battery life is a question mark especially over 2-3 years as currently even with moderate usage It gets me through a day ( but most phones have this problem so its not a deal breaker )Display legibility is not great especially under direct sunlight. this could be corrected with adaptive brightness but then indoors it becomes too bright.so drains the batteryOther than display legibility most of the above cons can be fixed by software updates I guess.",

Pros - Leather back warmth feelCons - Back Camera's not upto the mark when compared to the phones in market and of this price range, though it has given a sleek and leather finish with minimized thickness. . Silicon back case (if you're looking for touch and feel of leather back, better not use.. but use a side bumper if available for protection) Do also post where we can find side bumper, cos it's hard finding for new phones..

I am writing this as it happened:After a few days of usage of OPPO Reno 4 Pro, I started facing issues. Issues pertaining to lag while using Google Chrome, Generic apps andswitching between multiple tabs, I was completely unhappy with the productand I could clearly see the lack in  performance. When I flagged the issueon the 12th evening to Amazon services, an online tech diagnostic processwas initiated and later I was informed about a technician visiting mylocation/ residence on the 14th afternoon. (I was told that the returnwindow shall be extended for further 10 days as the product is beinginspected)When I tried reaching out to the technician, my calls were unanswered ( 6to be precise) and later that afternoon one of the tech representativecalls to inform me that the technician will not be  visiting and ifenquired by Amazon, I was requested to say that the visit was successfuland promised a refund process. Again after one day of no response, I made an effort to reach out to Amazonand explain the entire issue and now is where the Amazon agent clearlydenies to take any responsibility for after sale customer service anddiverts me to get in touch with OPPO directly. After numerous calls to OPPOand with no response from their end I had no place to go but to come backto you. After a long call with the amazon tech team, the young lady understands howunhappy I am as a customer using a phone that's a downgrade and going toand fro resolving this. As per the technician who did visit, agreed that there is lag in theusage but that's OPPO for you and signs off saying he'll have to resolvethe ticket, booking this under working fine. Absolutely Unhappy, first with Amazon having to reachout to express andexplain about my current status and give a download of a series of eventsthat's happened every time over a call again and again, Secondly usingOPPO, with its performance, Pathetic. It has taken a lot of mental stress going to and fro on this purchase withthe customer care.*I would request Amazon for a refund (within Amazon wallet) for thisproduct* as it's within the Return window : 12-Aug 2020, Later extended 10 days and I don't want to invest any further time on this. As I end, I would like to ask Amazon just one thing.",

I mean, typically a 4000mAh battery should last for 1 and a half day easily. I had to dip the phone in the charger atleast two to three times a day.

(In my personal opinion I don't think higher charging wattage like 65 watts is good for phone battery and sounds like a gimmick as even though they have double the wattage they usually charge a phone of smaller battery about 4000 mAH in about 40 minutes which is not much of a difference. ) Super steady video from rear camera because of presence of both EIS & OIS.9.Bigger battery 4780 mAH as compared to other flagship phones.10. Doesn't misses out on any feature like reverse wireless charging, 5g support (though in India not of use for at least couple of years), NFC, Dual GPS, capable of being connected to wifi and provide Hotspot simultaneously, No MIUI ads till date. The battery is bigger compared to many devices but looses about 10 to 20% even when left untouched overnight thus I'd say not so good battery management.6. I think that the phone is slightly overpriced at 50k but if we compare it with it`s biggest competitor the One plus 8 I will always choose MI 10 as so many things are missing in One plus 8 (like wireless charging, LP DDR RAM 4x is present instead of 5, comes with smaller battery 4300mAH and Sony IMX 586 Camera sensor which is quite outdated now) and have a price difference of only 5k.",

I would request all the user to kindly be careful when you are buying the product. Amazon very smartly mention at only one place that you can get only replacement and not refund. So the user has not other option left just to get the product replace. I can only pray that the product work atleast for 1 year and the replace product doesn't have the technical issue and i dont have to run behind the service center. I will definitely AVOID buying products from Amazon. Save  my money as I was planning to go for Prime membership.",

    "text": "Hi Guys, I would like to share my experience after using this budget phone for almost three weeks. The phones looks a bit premium when compared to the price paid and looks stylish. The update of MUI 10 OS after unboxing have made the phone navigation more fluidic and easy to use. C) Touch response over screen is cool and finger print detection takes just fraction of second to unlock or activate any set of commands. Face Unlock feature in this price range is really a premium thing we can boast off and it works well without any delay. E) Camera clarity is above average and do justice to the megapixel it claims. The portrait mode adds blur and make a good picture if you are in a well lit environment, or else it simply blurs portion of the space around the subject. Though preset ringtones are similar in sounds, the clarity is well good to be noticed even in nosy environment. Thankfully the heating issue is completely absent on normal usage of the phone. H) Have been using the phone for almost three weeks now I) Have a bunch of MI apps which you may not use and hence its better to disable or uninstall them. The phone doesn't come with a headset and hence you have to buy it separately. In overall a good budget phone with latest features.",

Even after upgrading the ios to 12.0.1, there seems to be no difference, I think the screen could have been used to fit in more text compared to the Xs. having said that, im used to big phones, the Pixel 2xl, the 6sPlus, so if you are a big phone person, go for this phone with eyes closed. If you are confused between apple and android flagships, let me tell you, I was on HTC for 3 years, then shifted to iphone 6s plus for 3 years and briefly shifted to pixel 2 xl, and  now finally to Xs Max, which I intend to use for the next 3 years. having used both, I definitely feel iphones are quite premium and offer the best tech. Almost all phones come with these features these days and after adapting to iphones technology, the other phones are going a step ahead, so definitely, apple is the trend setter! Comparing pixel 2xl with Xs Max, I found that the pixel 2 xl and even the pixel 2 get damn hot, definitely not the issue on the iphone. Iphone looks much better too! Also great touch interface! and now I know why some people are reluctant to switch to android from iphone!",

Is Apple expecting its users to change the phone which costs almost 1 lakh just becuse there is a crack on the screen?2. One Plus is providing free screen replacement warranty for a year that costs half the price of iPhone.3. Why can't iPhone users in India enjoy Apple Care + benefit similar to other country users for a small premium?4.
