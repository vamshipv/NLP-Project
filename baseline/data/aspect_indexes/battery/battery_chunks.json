However, for their improvement, I tried to give some critical feedback to the company over phone but it was not so easy, so, I am writing here sothat Samsung India can take this critical review for their improvement. Battery:Battery is 7K mha but it is draining so fast that its overall backup time is slightly better than any other average phone. In this price segment, Samsung can easily provide metallic back for better appearance and transfer of heat. Overall, its good non chini phone with good camera and display, a bit bulky, satisfactory speed, scope of tremendous improvement in UI and setting, and bit overpriced.",

I have done every troubleshooting step suggested by Samsung Tech support:1. The most irritating thing is how can a company like Samsung mess-up such a basic feature & to the surprise, even the tech support has now run out of troubleshooting solutions. Instead of replacing it with new phone, tech support has now told me to get the hardware fixed from Samsung Service centre. I don't get it why should I take a brand new phone to service center & get it opened. Instead a replacement of this phone should be there, I have not even used it for more than an hour. Last year I ordered an MI phone from Flipkart, the battery was getting drained very fast. Within the next day, the phone was replaced without questions asked.

No Carrier aggregation: Using Jio sim in Samsung M51 and realme X2 pro and both contain different net speed in which Samsung giving me 5mbps and realme x2 pro giving me 9-10mbps.14. Camera Zoom quality is not good. When you focus on Sky whole pic turn into blue. i.e saturation level is too much high in this phone (Image attached).16.

Beautiful looks! Finally I can delete SMS from notification now!!- Display is excellent with Blue light filter.- Performance is good. No heating or lagging. Real Racing worked fine.- 6000 Mah battery is BIG- 128 GB storage is pretty good. 512 GB card supported with dedicated external card slot.- Both dedicated sim slots support LTE- Fast charging and 15W charger top with phone. The phone came with 0% charge. Charged fast.- Mobile speakers sound is good, but I prefer external speakers for better bass in music.- Camera is really good. Macro performance is very good - look at skin in tatoo photo and dust perticles in deskphone photo!! (photos of M31 are from other phone). Both front and rear camera support FHD video 3840x2160. I may not require to carry my DSLR everyehere.- Face unlock / figure-print sensor response is good- Received next day by 11 AM ! Not that thin, but ok.- Doesn't have Samsung Dex- Started to Boot Screen!! An Android Updated (other than many application updates which is normal in any case) appeared on within days of launch. No issue at all.- Feels delicate in hand but a Rs.49 cover was good enough. Wrongly ordered black while the set is blue. Just 49 so will reorder the blue one as well :)- Called Samsung Store, but no information with them about availability date. Feedback- Feels good in hand and in use. It is a powerhouse and you feel it.- Will update after few days of use, but don't have any doubt as of now.",

    "text": "Honest review for a Honest Samsung phone. I am writing this review after using M31s for more than half month. And my verdict based on truly improved Samsung M series with my experience & tested after usage only. BUILD QUALITY. Superior, as it matches any S series flagship premium in classy look, strong built for this budget amount. My hand is small but still I found 6.5 inches display is good to handle as it is well managed for one hand use also. DISPLAY & FINGERPRINT.With Samsung SuperAmoled display you can truly trust the amazing view angle. Now in M31s feature of Widevine L Certification you can enjoy all those global Dolby theatre experience. I found it reliable for my 1920p to 4k level of movie watching without any distraction due to Infinite O display which gives Full Screen Ratio. benefit of this midrange M series is it's maasive 6000mAh battery which gave me enough juice for nearly 3 days continuously. CAMERA.This time M series did a honest job by giving us a INTELLI camera of 64 mwgapixel with Single Take feature. Samsung gives what it advertises. My usage of Camera is high & I found no complaints at all in focusing a shoot. The depth & clarity of 64 megapixel is more developed in this M31s model. PROCESSOR.After using for more than half month I must say, Exynos 9611 works wonderful liquid speed when it is combined with LPDDR4X RAM technology. I have not faced any lag in PUBG or ASPHALT-9 hight end games, in medium setting which is good for battery saving. SOUND QUALITY.After using for hours I found the Speaker this time Samsung made is much improved with Bass Stereo which was missing earlier. The in-ear delivers your ear the pure Dolby Atmos with clear precision and crystal clear bass effect.",

(you get reverse charging as well).The only con i felt till now is the exclusion of a phone cover in the box. 50Rs??M31s is actually A51 without on screen fp. It has better specs than A51 which retails around 8-9k than M31s which makes this phone one of a kind. The dimensions are also the same as A51. So you can use the same tempered glass but cant use A51 back cover for M31s since it should have the cutout for side mounted fp scanner. Overall a great phone.",

    "text": "Hi all,From Samsung M31s. I have to take care my SaM31s like a baby. Size wise bit bigger that 1+6 (6.5\")Comparing to Nord, we have Memory card slot - no dependency. Battery lasts more than 36hrs (with Bluetooth earphone at times).Charging happened in 70-75 mins with intermediate usage in between. Earphone Jack available comparing to Nord, better than Bluetooth earphone which consumes charge and needs charge for earphones too. Settings - an ocean of settings, wonderful touch sensor and additional features for lock facilities. Audio - Its so good with clear audio in all needs. Photo - Video : Excellent quality of photos and Videos even in a 3x Zoom. Front camera is bit down. Macro Mode is giving a great pic of Close shots. Has Slowmo, Super slowmo, Hyperlapse, Panaroma. AR zone is pure magical. Different features for Front cam and Back cam. Reverse charging facility is amazing. Overall - M31s is a price worthy with sooo many options. EDIT : Corning Gorilla Glass 3 is fine,just on 10th day of my purchase, my phone fallen down with less than 1m height (slipped from hand) and display borken \ud83d\udc94Handle with care.",

The design actually fits the hand well as it is shorter than usual on breadth, and a bit more on length, all the more better viewing experience.6) Gaming performance is average. (Similar phones in this range have better gaming performances)7) The phone looks and feels premium while using.8) Face Unlock is as fast as other OnePlus phones. 4K video recording @ 60fps is absent but 1080@60fps performance is quite good. The mono speaker is on the bottom right of the phone, which tends to get covered by your hand while using. Also, being on just one side of the phone, the audio isn't as well delivered as it is on a stereo speaker.4) The plastic frame (doesn't look like plastic but it is) is a worrying thing and makes the phone *comparatively* less durable.6) Fingerprint scanner being under the screen isn't as quick as a traditional fingerprint scanner on the back.

For others, one plus 8T(lighter than pro model at 180 gms) would be ideal which should bring 120Hz refresh rate and maybe wireless charging too.. And for those who can afford and dont mind a heavy phone(200+ gms), One plus 8 pro or 8T Pro would be ideal ones.(As per Amazon reviews some users are reporting display issues with 8 pro, so 8T Pro hopefully will be a better model.) I still use 7T pro which provides the best of One Plus experience...INITIAL IMPRESSIONS:No tint issue which has been widely reported. Camera quality on par with top model one plus devices in case of outdoor pictures, Indoor/low light pictures are not that good...Not a fan of punch hole cameras..would have preferred full screen with pop up instead.",

    "text": "I changed OnePlus 8, 4 times! Due to something or the other defects (like headache giving screens, line marks at the back of the body, etc) as it's expensive!Phone boxes were puffed, torned, some displays were dull if noticed closely, more warm and yellowish. No control by OnePlus on this. People go nuts like \"wow what a display\" not realizing that they are being given inferior quality displays of Samsung. I hope I really hope people strive for perfection to really understand and get what they are paying for by controlling their excitements a bit and forward stronger feedbacks, as I believe I was listened and Amazon India did helped me too. My 5th device came altogether from a different location, excellent box, phone built and display feels more broader even with same dimensions, no two parallel lines design or defect at the back, it's clean and curvy like OnePlus 8 8gb variant (mine is the 6gb one). Screen display is still more warm which I didn't want but colors are very punchy and clearly shows the display is far better than previous returned devices.1st OnePlus 8 8gb - Had a very long permanent line mark at the back of the body if looked closely.2nd OnePlus 8 8gb - Display's blue light filter had issues I'm sure as it gave me headache in seconds, eye strain as well.3rd OnePlus 8 6gb - 2 parallel lines on edges of the back body if the device was tilted a little, was like a dent kind of design or defect (I believe though this one had the best display even than the 5th one that I'm keeping and more smoother 90 HZ).4th OnePlus 8 6gb - 2 parallel lines were again there so I thought it's normal and was okay with it, but display was yellowish and dull, playing pubg with graphics optimization made the game look more ugly in extreme hd settings (hdr sucks). Looking at Images on articles, etc were looking just good.5th OnePlus 8 6gb variant - As told above there are no 2 parallel lines, punchy colors, not dull and very good display, however still yellowish in large part of the screen and whitish around above and right & left edges of the screen in vivid mode (I did noticed in some displays it was not this warm). I also noticed vivid mode was nicer and whiter in previous devices than this one whether they were dull or not. I also know screen being yellowish a bit makes video viewing an amazing experience to make it more natural for skin color, etc. However, I'm tierd and somewhat satisfied but will want OnePlus to correct if possible with software update without compromising any quality of the display. It's said that Apple never compromises on quality, they even delay their production if they find any imperfections (I don't like iOS or use Apple though). OnePlus should do like this. I noticed paying more (when I got the 8gb one) was really like getting better qalutiy made device (the first one, if the issue mentioned wasn't there). This shouldn't be the case as this leads to disappointment and all variants should be given the same attention/perfection with just internal hardware changes. OnePlus 8 will be my first and last device for a short period of time.",

There is only one way you will be happy with this purchase and that is, if you are looking for a slim, elegant, powerful, light weight device offering a premium in-hand feel. Camera is going to serve you well on many occasions (when the lighting is good). People might have told you that the camera system is mediocre. There have been few software updates and I can confidently say that yes, the camera is neither great nor is it bad. It delivers decent pictures (when the lighting is good) and if you are not a absolute camera geek, then this will meet and succeed all of your expectations. Incase you are a camera geek, then get the 8Pro and dont think about saving money. Conclusion: Feels expensive and has a nice balance in the hand (Its very light and is a joy to use). The glacial green in matte finish is makes the front of the device look expensive (with the dark edge-to-edge AMOLED panel).",

    "text": "After reading a lot of geeky reviews on YouTube and portals, I bought Oneplus7t. Pls, note I have been using OnePlus from last many years now so my expectations were clear. My experience with the device says that most of the reviews or unboxing things are influenced. Pls, note I have bought it with my own money unlike leading reviewers or unboxing video geeks who get it for free. Go for users reviews who bought them with their own money. So I am writing my 5 days experience with the phone. A regular user who wants to do all the office work on the phone, social media, blogging and vlogging, etc. The last OnePlus phone I was using was Oneplus 5 and was quite happy with it until it screen got broken and replacement cost was higher than the selling price of the device itself. I have clicked a magazine cover picture with my Oneplus 5 which had only 16 MP camera but pic quality was natural and good. Battery:  Battery is avg. All those time I teased my iPhone or Samsung Series colleagues and friends for their battery life. This offers an avg battery life. I never carried a charger with me in previous models if I Start with 90% even after two years. I m wondering what would be this phone battery life in a year or more.4. 90 Hz refresh rate is a gimmick to sell this device. It will give you fluid experience but the soon it consumes battery you will always prefer to keep it to 60hz which is an option given in the display settings. If you always stick to a desk or have a power source around you can keep it to 90hz. Not for people who are on the move most of the time. Sound: Phone calls are not crisp and clear. At times the caller's voice gets hazy and husky. Voice is even audible to person the person sitting next to me. Speakers volume is loud but the sound quality is not good.6. With multiple variants, it has joined the league of Samsung, Mi, Oppo, Vivo. Now they are launching 7t pro on Oct 10 again it is a disappointment for those who bought 7t on day 1. Maybe their R&D or trials have some problem here that in every two months they are launching a new device with an update to the previous faults. Like OnePlus 7 has voice receiver on one side which is right. So if you take calls or hear the phone from left you won't get a clear voice or volume. So they added receivers on both the side in this device. No camera quality, no battery life, no sound quality on calls, getting wounds on holding it for long. I have always recommended OnePlus devices to everyone around and had high hopes and trust on the brand that I bought it on the day of the launch but with this experience, I won't recommend OnePlus 7t to my colleagues and friends who are planning to upgrade their devices.",

Picture quality did not come out well. Still, I thought it may be light or background because of my previous experiences I could not believe it to be not good. So I continued clicking pictures which really missed detailing. As you zoom in it will make it blurred. It clicks blur pics may it has to do with image Stabilization.3.

    "text": "I bought this 12GB+256GB Glacial Green variant and physically it looks stunning. The design is top-notch. The punch hole camera does not spoil the overall screen experience as some people have said. Very sleek and premium looking design-wise. The battery life does not last really long when you use it on 120 Hz QHD+, although it's quite manageable and can get through the day with mid usage easily. Coming to gaming, I'm a hardcore gamer and can game continuously for 3-4 hours, and let me tell you this phone can run through it with ease. I've played PUBG quite a lot on this device and have not noticed any major frame drops at HDR graphics and Extreme frame rates, let alone Smooth graphics. It runs PUBG really smoothly. Stable frames at all times. I would suggest it for competitive PUBG and other games too. The 120 Hz Amoled screen is breathtaking. Buttery smooth at all times. Certainly the best display on a phone. I have found the cameras to be decent enough. Nothing too fancy, nor a let down. Videos are very stable though. This has come close to the iPhone cameras as a video shooter. This might even offer better stabilization than the iPhone videos. The colour filter camera is disabled out of the box. Speakers are fairly loud and clear. A very good surround experience. You'll find a Dolby sample video in your gallery. Play it on the phone speakers and see for yourself. The phone that I had received, I used it for about 2 weeks and discovered it had this image retention issue. The afterimage of anything displayed for a period of time on the phone for a long time is displayed on the screen even after the original image is pulled off. This could be seen while watching Youtube videos in non-fill screen mode or videos that have any kind of frame visible or even games like PUBG where static elements of game like the map's frame or your controls would be visible on certain background colours even after you have turned the game off. I had reset the phone and not seen any kind of improvement. Also, my screen had no green tints. The image retention issue could easily turn into permanent screen burns really soon. Hope you people find this review useful. Not a very organized review but that's what I have experienced.",

    "text": "====I am a Design Specialist by Profession & also into Mobile Photography, hence I was hooked in using the Pixel 2XL. This phone is a worthy upgrade if you're transitioning from Galaxy S9 / Pixel 1 or 2 series / OnePlus 6, 6T & below / iPhone X or 7 and below. OnePlus 7T Pro is only an incremental upgrade over it's predecessor OnePlus 7 Pro.===== What has been improved over the 7 Pro? ====+ Faster Processor. Snapdragon 855 Plus.+ Adreno 640. Better Gaming Performance.+ Better Haptic Motor. Same as the 7T.+ Fast Charging. Warp 30T Technology.+ Brighter Nits (Upto 1000 compared to 800 of 7 Pro)+ Super Macro Mode, Night reading Modes, Android 10 out of the box, Better Nightscape 2.0. These software updates will be eventually updated for the 7 Pro as well.==== ====OnePlus 7T Pro Device. And some cool OnePlus Stickers.==== Display ====Firstly, OnePlus 7T Pro has a stunning display over its predecessors. I'm personally not a fan of notches nor do I click a lot of selfies, so I prefer the OnePlus 7T Pro's Fluid Display. Feels more luxurious over the 7T. However, you should also note that in different lighting conditions, 7T Pro has glares at the curves due to the rounder corners which I believe is negligible. You would never want to get back to 60Hz once you're used to this.==== Performance ====Snapdragon 855 Plus is one of the best CPUs out there (at the time of writing this review) and with Adrena 640, it takes gaming and multi-tasking to another league. Plus is at par with the A13 Bionic from Apple. RAM Management is splendid & 8GB RAM is recommended unless you want to get the 12 Gig McLaren Edition to save on a few seconds everyday.==== Camera ====I honestly have to admit that it's not the best out there as I was expecting a leap from it's predecessors. It still uses the Sony IMX 586 (48 MP) for it's main sensor and it's Telephoto at 2.2X optical (3X lossless) and is at par with iPhone. But when compared with the GCam Mod, the OnePlus Camera seems to have improved a lot from it's previous versions. Apple iPhone 11 takes the lead here. Software ====This is one of the biggest features for you to switch to the OnePlus. Stock Android was butter smooth while I missed out on a lot of simple gestures like Longer Screenshots, Silence Button, Customized Navigational elements & much more which lacked on the Stock OS from Google. I would say Oxygen OS should be set as a benchmark for Google to include these incremental features on their upcoming flagships. Oxygen OS has presently the best OS Experience for Android.==== Battery ====Warp T30 is super fast. It helps you charge from 0-100 in lesser time than an episode on Netflix. Although not the fastest charger in the industry, it still gets through a day on heavy usage.==== What could've been improved ====- Minor improvements on Camera.- No Wireless Charging.- IP Rating.- Better silicon case should be included in their future upgrades.==== Verdict ====No doubt that the ASUS Fans would recommend the ROG 2. ROG 2 is hands down the best gaming phone with 120 HZ Display but lacks majorly on other aspects like software updates, Telephoto Camera, Splash Proof, Build Quality and security patches which are very essential for business professionals or regular consumers. ASUS is also not known to provide regular updates to it's consumers over the OnePlus which has a closely knit community among the developers and has more Brand Value than ASUS & nevertheless to mention that the OnePlus 7T Pro feels premium out of the box. If you're planning to upgrade from a device almost 2 years old then this would be the best upgrade in case you require a phone with no-notch and curved screen. 7T Pro feels very slippery when compared to the 7T. I wish they made smaller devices. Otherwise I would still recommend the 7T which is the best bang for your buck. If you still wish to own this but cannot afford the extra rupee on incremental updates (Fast Charging, 855 Plus) , my suggestion would be is to go for the OnePlus 7 Pro. It's still one of the best devices out there.",

The Wide Angle is fairly okayish with some distortions being present at the edges. Nightscape is now available for Wide Angle shots too.==== Video ====If you're into Video Recording, then be a bit disappointed to hear this as it isn't the best while it can still take average videos without much shake utilizing the OIS and EIS at 1080P and just OIS at 4K 60FPS. It still doesn't shoot 4K in wide angle. OIS and EIS combined together has a lot of warping and rolling shutter which is a turn off for video producers. It's still not an alternate for a Gimbal. The videos look oversaturated too which can be fixed by shooting on a Third Party app like Filmic Pro.==== No ToF sensor-",

You just can't stop admiring it.2)Excellent camera - The pictures come out so well in all kinds of lighting and modes. *Portrait*- The new zoom mode in portrait is just wow. Looks exactly like DSLR clicks. Macro - I love taking closeup shots of flowers and patterns and with this...you can get as close as 2.5 cms and click amazing shots. You get crisp and clear pictures without any noise. Popup camera - If you are hesitant or doubtful about popup cameras...I am telling you there is nothing to worry... It is Soo smooth and quick that you never will notice it is a hardware controlled camera. Selfies have never been this better. Bright and sharp shots anytime. Will update later3)Dolby speakers - Excellent sound quality with awesome stereo effect. Once again a huge upgrade over the older models.4)90 Hz refresh rate - It is clearly faster and better than the usual 60Hz displays.5)Build and design - Just perfect... It's sleek...stylish and neat. And I totally loved the edge display in OnePlus 7 pro. This device is just a perfect combination of the best features in the 7t and the 7pro and NOT an unwanted model like everyone is claiming.6) Batter and charging - The charging is blazing fast and the battery very easily lasts a whole day,even with 90Hz refresh rate.",

No green tint / black crush issue found on my device. Camera:It is clear that only 3 rear camera are working right now. No color filter is working. It may redeaign and enable later via software update. Rather than every sensor of all camera working fine. Pictures taken by rear camera with all mode is so bright that u can find every details in the pictures.48 MP wide angle camera is take so wide and beautiful pictures. On front camera section it take good bright pictures, but i think in portrait mode it take little bit artistic image than real. Slow-Mo working fine. Macro working fine. Battery:Battery backup is good. 30 W Warp charger  chage the device very fast. 19 hrs before charging and its still 6 hrs left. Screen on time is approx 8 hrs. No wireless charger so dont know about wireless chaging. Oxygen OS:This is my 3rd OP devices and the best part which i love is its Oxygen OS. OnePlus own gestures is also missing this time. Proximity sensor working fine. Pocket mode working fine. Fingerprint sensor is superfast. Face unlock also superfast. Sound & Vibration:Sound is good but i think ring volume is little bit low. Speaker is loud, you can use Dolby Atmos enhancement also. Heptic feedback is low which is good. Network:OP 8 Pro not support our own navigation system NavIC right now. No announcement from OnePlus also. Qualcomm announced that its 865 Snapdragon processor support NavIC system. So dont worry ur hardware support NavIC. Maybe software update comes later.",

Very difficult to use with one hand.- Fingerprint scanner and Face unlocks works like a charm.- Design is great and the available color options are different and awesome.- Earpiece volume during calls are not the greatest but adequate. OP3 earpiece volume had deteriorated very much over time.- Rear Camera has improved a lot, but I can already feel that there are still rooms for improvement. Also, watch YT videos in landscape mode.- Lack of the 3.5mm headphone jack is the biggest let down for me in this phone. The Ultramarine Blue is fantastic \ud83d\ude0d.Finally, if the price is not a deal breaker, then I *Highly Recommend* this \"Flagship\" phone from OnePlus.",

    "text": "I am a long time customer of oneplus phones and since last 3 years I have been using oneplus 5 and that phone is as good as new. Here are some of the issues I am facing with the new onplus 8 pro.- Battery - The phone doesn't last one day with full charge. I dont play any games, my phone usage is mainly social media, instagram,facebook,reddit, twitter and bunch of other photo edit tools like lightroom and snapseed. If I charge full and start my day, then by evening 8pm  my phone is battery saver mode. Which is not the case on my oneplus 5 even after 3 years. And its more concerning because I don't use any of the power hungry games or apps. Btw I have removed 120hz refresh rate on the first week itself and all this battery issue is even when I am using it at 60hz refresh rate with default app/battery settings. I bought the oneplus 8 pro selling my DSLR camera so that I can record all my videos on phone itself plus its waterproof. Recently I shot a video at 4k 60fps and I guess within few minutes the phone got so heated that it disabled the camera from video shooting until the phone cooled down!! Now whats the use if I cant record a video even for few minutes straight on 4K?Camera - To be honest, stabilization is really great while recording video however photos are almost as good as oneplus 5 if not slightly better. But nothing that worth paying double the price you pay over oneplus 5. Video clarity is really great, far better than the oneplus 5. Wide angle is the only thing I felt is worth compared to oneplus 5.Apart from the above rest of the things are good I feel. Fingerprint lockscreen works mostly 70% of the time. Overall I regret buying the phone. Even if they had fixed the battery issues, this phone would have been a great choice.",

IPhone 7----> camera not as good as galaxy s8 , pixel or one plus. why spend so much when one plus 5 is available at nearly half the priceLG G6 & Samsung S8---> did not consider Korean phones especially after my experience with G3.coming to the phone usage. I will not speak about the specs as most reviews highlight it in detailwhat I liked!Blazing fast  while opening closing apps etcCamera is quite good! I would not rate it as good as pixel, but produces very acceptable quality in most lighting conditionsdesign is very slim. but I would recommend a case as it is slippery especially while trying to take selfiesVideos are with Electronic image stabilisation ( 4K too) which is brilliant!Dash charge is very good!latest OS 4.5.8 update is available also to downloadwhat I dislikedCamera app is very basic. not so much customisations such as gesture shutter. there is a smile shutter which is too responsive and clicks away!Gallery app is also very vanilla. Battery life is a question mark especially over 2-3 years as currently even with moderate usage It gets me through a day ( but most phones have this problem so its not a deal breaker )Display legibility is not great especially under direct sunlight. this could be corrected with adaptive brightness but then indoors it becomes too bright.so drains the batteryOther than display legibility most of the above cons can be fixed by software updates I guess.",

Dash Charge: In the fast paced world, the faster the phone charges, the better it is. And the OnePlus\u2019s Dash Charge proves that point beyond a doubt. Just like the OnePlus 3/3T, the OnePlus 5 also comes packed with the mighty Dash Charger. The Dash Charge is capable of charging the phone from 0-60% in just 30 mins and that\u2019s more than impressive.4. OS:The Oxygen OS software has been updated to Oreo in the last week that we have been using it. It adds some light, useful and tasteful customizations on top of stock Android that add value. and it\u2019s impressive how OnePlus can strike the right balance so early in the game. I particularly find gestures (including alternate actions you can assign to navigation keys) and the left home screen pane very helpful.5. Battery And Audio:The 3300mAh battery on the OnePlus 5 can comfortably last for one moderate usage day. The Dash charge is incredibly fast as ever and will prove to be a big convenience. The loudspeaker on the phone is present on the bottom edge. It\u2019s quite average in terms of loudness but the audio quality is reasonable. Audio output via headphones is very good. The call quality on the phone is excellent. But After So Much Some Things Got Missed Like*OIS Camera Stabilizer*Not IPS Certified*2K Display Resolution*Also Dual Camera Needs Some FixesBut over all its a power packed phone with a reasonable price.#And 5T has made some improvements on camera which are missing on 5 but Front Fingerprint Scanner lover chosse Oneplus 5 \ud83d\ude09.Thats all, Hope I have helped a lot.",

The phone is surprisingly good. It has a good camera which has multiple modes to click photos. It's front camera is top notch. I think if you get this phone for less than 20k by exchanging your old phone, it is totally worth it. It is a very light phone btw. This is a day 1 review, first impression and a few hours of usage after full battery. It charges real quick btw.

Camera is decent for video calls/ normal phots not that great especially for shotting long-distance objects/ sceneries. Design is excellent and it is the slimmest phone at 7.43mm6. Sound is good but not that great for melodies or any songs please use earphones/headphones.8. Display is really good and it's out of my expectation as I'm using Samsung AMOLED previously.9. Processor is fast for general purpose and played COD and some other games at medium graphics didn't observe any lag.10.

I got a clear 7 hrs ON-screen time with heavy usage On 120 Hz , Auto Fhd-Qhd . It was just a day of use and I'll update my thoughts after spending more time. EDIT -I have attatched camera samples .After 3 weeks of use -1. Display is one of the best.2. I had one of the best experience using Netflix and Youtube.3. Charging and battery - The battery lasts 7 hrs on heavy usage constantly and can be fully charged under 40 minutes . The battery standby is also good.4. Camera is good and it depends on the individuals use , as to what that person demands from the cam. I had a good experience with it. Front camera was really good and gave decent selfies. I did observe a dynamic range difference when shifting from normal to ultrawide sensor.5. No heating issues during heavy usage and charging . But did observe some while recording video . The regions around the rear cam gets heated up during recording. UI was okayish but could definitely improve. I was using Oneplus 5 for 3 years and shift from oxygen to color OS was observable. One hand mode was of great use .7. The curved edges and design are beautiful . The case sent along with the phone was also good. The charger wires could have been of better quality. Its almost identical to what Oneplus has to offer except for the smaller ultrawide camera sensors and an increase in price by 5k . The price would have been perfect at around 55k-60k. Final Verdict -It depends on the persons preference . If you are a person who would want a premium feel smartphone with excellent display, video streming experience , good design, good camera setup and fast charging : Go for this one . It would definitely win your hearts - a quality product from Oppo.",

    "text": "At the onset I would like to express how unsatisfied I am as a customerafter purchasing OPPO and the series of instances that have taken placeover the past one week. I am writing this as it happened:After a few days of usage of OPPO Reno 4 Pro, I started facing issues. Issues pertaining to lag while using Google Chrome, Generic apps andswitching between multiple tabs, I was completely unhappy with the productand I could clearly see the lack in  performance. When I flagged the issueon the 12th evening to Amazon services, an online tech diagnostic processwas initiated and later I was informed about a technician visiting mylocation/ residence on the 14th afternoon. (I was told that the returnwindow shall be extended for further 10 days as the product is beinginspected)When I tried reaching out to the technician, my calls were unanswered ( 6to be precise) and later that afternoon one of the tech representativecalls to inform me that the technician will not be  visiting and ifenquired by Amazon, I was requested to say that the visit was successfuland promised a refund process. Again after one day of no response, I made an effort to reach out to Amazonand explain the entire issue and now is where the Amazon agent clearlydenies to take any responsibility for after sale customer service anddiverts me to get in touch with OPPO directly. After numerous calls to OPPOand with no response from their end I had no place to go but to come backto you. After a long call with the amazon tech team, the young lady understands howunhappy I am as a customer using a phone that's a downgrade and going toand fro resolving this. As per the technician who did visit, agreed that there is lag in theusage but that's OPPO for you and signs off saying he'll have to resolvethe ticket, booking this under working fine. Absolutely Unhappy, first with Amazon having to reachout to express andexplain about my current status and give a download of a series of eventsthat's happened every time over a call again and again, Secondly usingOPPO, with its performance, Pathetic. It has taken a lot of mental stress going to and fro on this purchase withthe customer care.*I would request Amazon for a refund (within Amazon wallet) for thisproduct* as it's within the Return window : 12-Aug 2020, Later extended 10 days and I don't want to invest any further time on this. As I end, I would like to ask Amazon just one thing.",

    "text": "After using the all new Samsung Galaxy A30s, i truly found that this is a nice little budget phone for day to day consumers. It has got a decent battery backup, display's amazing (first time using an AMOLED display), the triple camera setup is quite useful and has good color reproduction but it somehow cannot try to get a good shot at night. I mean the pictures are not so bad, but there is definitely some tuning required to make the camera take good shots at night. The fingerprint reader is very fast but be careful to use a certified and original screen guards or protectors as the fingerprint does struggle in screen guards. Included accessories are a pretty decent specially the included fast charger with the Type-C cable pretty sturdy. Overall this phone is a good competitor against chinese manufacturers. PROS:--Supports fast charge and has pretty decent charge rates-Has NFC which enables in wireless payments and support for Android Beam (unless Android 10 comes)-Has a good 4000mAh battery, pretty decent for bit of heavy users-Has on-screen fingerprint which is good-Camera setup is goodCONS:--Camera struggles to shoot better pictures at night-The included night mode requires a little bit software upgrade-OneUI which is extremely good, but the icons are kind of kiddish-And mostly- Where is Bixby voice assistant?There is bixby home though but this phone does not support Bixby voice assistantOverall the cons are not a big factor. Most of the cons are fixable by latter FOTA upgradesSo if you are looking for a budget option, go for itThis is my review after using the A30s for 3 months. Firstly speaking, samsung claims to have a 4000mAh battery, which sounds good but use it and you will feel that it is not actually keeping the charge for the required hoped time. I mean, typically a 4000mAh battery should last for 1 and a half day easily. I had to dip the phone in the charger atleast two to three times a day. And strictly speaking, i don't play heavy games like PUBG or COD. I am just a day to day user. But you cant complain if the phone charges in 45 mins. Another thing i want to mention, please keep a 4D tempered glass screen protector otherwise a single hard drop in that AMOLED screen will cause a good beautiful crack in the screen. Also i feel like the speaker of this phone is not upto the mark. Like, i've used budget phones like realme 3, Asus zenfone max pro m1, Asus max pro m2, redmi 7a. Also, the fingerprint get's slow as you use it. But despite all of these, samsung strictly gets a plus mark for it's awesome update schedule.",

Symmetric stereo speakers. Nice camera with with very good quality low light or night photography which still many flagship phones lack.5. Amoled screen brightness is excellent and there is no issue in viewing display even while the display is directly facing towards the sun.7. Excellent charging with 30 watts wired and wireless charging. I tried charging the phone from dead 0 to 100 and achieved it just under 1 hour. (In my personal opinion I don't think higher charging wattage like 65 watts is good for phone battery and sounds like a gimmick as even though they have double the wattage they usually charge a phone of smaller battery about 4000 mAH in about 40 minutes which is not much of a difference. ) Super steady video from rear camera because of presence of both EIS & OIS.9.Bigger battery 4780 mAH as compared to other flagship phones.10. Doesn't misses out on any feature like reverse wireless charging, 5g support (though in India not of use for at least couple of years), NFC, Dual GPS, capable of being connected to wifi and provide Hotspot simultaneously, No MIUI ads till date. The limitation of resolution of the screen FHD+. The bigger size of the screen results in lower ppi and thus stands nowhere near QHD+ displays.2. This phone comes with Global MIUI 11 and has Google dialer and messaging app thus misses out features like call recording, phone notes etc. 3. Trust me this MIUI has a lot of bugs and thus results in issues like while using finger print scanner, the device heats up at times even during normal usage, but the overall performance is acceptable. (Hopefully most of the issues will be resolved by MIUI 12 update which is going to be available soon)4. Outdated front camera and supporting rear cameras hardware. (The 20 MP front camera and that too without EIS, 2 MP macro camera, 2 MP depth camera and 13 MP ultrawide camera seems like a joke for a 2020 flagship phone with the price of 50k.)5. The battery is bigger compared to many devices but looses about 10 to 20% even when left untouched overnight thus I'd say not so good battery management.6. Misses out a 3.5 mm Jack and also the c type to 3.5 mm Jack converter provided in the box doesn't seem to be of a very good quality as per my initial impression.7. Though the low light photography is good but daylight photography is not that exceptional as one might expect from 108 MP camera.8. (Maybe just in my case)Pricing issues - Though there are two things which have gone against Xiaomi as well as other Mobile brands1) Higher import duties for imported phones. I think that the phone is slightly overpriced at 50k but if we compare it with it`s biggest competitor the One plus 8 I will always choose MI 10 as so many things are missing in One plus 8 (like wireless charging, LP DDR RAM 4x is present instead of 5, comes with smaller battery 4300mAH and Sony IMX 586 Camera sensor which is quite outdated now) and have a price difference of only 5k. However in comparison with One plus 8 pro I feel that MI 10 is slightly behind because of the MIUI bugs related flaws, FHD+ display and outdated secondary camera hardware (including front camera. Thus I believe that if the aforementioned issues would have been addressed by Xiaomi I would have considered this phone justifying the price completely and without a doubt would have been the best phone ever under 50k. However in reality still the phone is definitely a strong competitor in the flagship mobile segment.",

The update of MUI 10 OS after unboxing have made the phone navigation more fluidic and easy to use. C) Touch response over screen is cool and finger print detection takes just fraction of second to unlock or activate any set of commands. Face Unlock feature in this price range is really a premium thing we can boast off and it works well without any delay. E) Camera clarity is above average and do justice to the megapixel it claims. The portrait mode adds blur and make a good picture if you are in a well lit environment, or else it simply blurs portion of the space around the subject. Though preset ringtones are similar in sounds, the clarity is well good to be noticed even in nosy environment. Thankfully the heating issue is completely absent on normal usage of the phone. H) Have been using the phone for almost three weeks now I) Have a bunch of MI apps which you may not use and hence its better to disable or uninstall them. The phone doesn't come with a headset and hence you have to buy it separately. In overall a good budget phone with latest features.",

The A11 Bionic chip has played an absolute  role in maximising the efficiency of the iPhone 8. As for the battery, it\u2019s always better to turn off the mobile data or Wi-Fi on an iPhone when not in use to make the battery last longer than usual. When it comes to make a choice between an iPhone 8 and an iPhone 8 Plus, I\u2019d personally recommend the 8. The screen size is pretty decent, fits in your pocket well & at the same time the iPhone 8 maintains the essence of an iPhone. However, if you\u2019re into larger phones or photography (Dual Camera & the Portrait Mode), the 8 Plus is a great option. The all-glass panel makes the iPhone 8 a bit heavier than the iPhone 7 however, it adds to the style making the device look more premium. I\u2019m not really into photography so wouldn\u2019t comment about the camera but the iPhone cameras have always been the eye candy for almost everyone.",

Even after upgrading the ios to 12.0.1, there seems to be no difference, I think the screen could have been used to fit in more text compared to the Xs. having said that, im used to big phones, the Pixel 2xl, the 6sPlus, so if you are a big phone person, go for this phone with eyes closed. If you are confused between apple and android flagships, let me tell you, I was on HTC for 3 years, then shifted to iphone 6s plus for 3 years and briefly shifted to pixel 2 xl, and  now finally to Xs Max, which I intend to use for the next 3 years. having used both, I definitely feel iphones are quite premium and offer the best tech. Almost all phones come with these features these days and after adapting to iphones technology, the other phones are going a step ahead, so definitely, apple is the trend setter! Comparing pixel 2xl with Xs Max, I found that the pixel 2 xl and even the pixel 2 get damn hot, definitely not the issue on the iphone. Iphone looks much better too! Also great touch interface! and now I know why some people are reluctant to switch to android from iphone!",

For the record, Apple will support this phone with software updates for 5 years...the Note 9 is a 2018 phone running 2017 Android software and Samsung gives software updates for 3 years. I\u2019ll list some pros and cons and also what the tech media won\u2019t tell you. Pros:- battery life is all day- upgraded speakers get real loud- fast and smooth- Siri has been given shortcuts- upgraded cameras are just as good as Samsung cameras now and the front camera is better than the Note 9 front cameraCons:- expensive- slow speed charger- A case is almost mandatory especially if you are clumsyBottom line...the iPhone and Galaxy phones are the best phones on the market right now. The iPhone is a step ahead because iOS gets frequent updates and starting with iOS 12 Apple actually sped up old iPhones and iPads which will allow users to keep their devices longer. An iPhone is now like a laptop and something you only need to upgrade once it breaks. The iPhone is also the ONLY smartphone that can stream all video apps in full screen. Android doesn\u2019t have full screen built into the OS so video apps like HBO, Showtime, Cinemax, STARZ, Encore, and EPIC are all tiny on the Note 9...those apps are all full screen on the iPhone.",

When I inquired about Apple Care protection on the device, he mentioned that Apple does not have any warranty against Screen damages in India and it is available in US and other countries.1. Is Apple expecting its users to change the phone which costs almost 1 lakh just becuse there is a crack on the screen?2. One Plus is providing free screen replacement warranty for a year that costs half the price of iPhone.3. Why can't iPhone users in India enjoy Apple Care + benefit similar to other country users for a small premium?4. This strongly discourages Indian consumers to go for an expensive phone if screen damages are not covered. Apple gadgets users are at a disadvantage if expensive costs for maintenance continues.",

    "text": "This is my 3rd iPhone after iPhone 4S and iPhone 6S Plus. Being an utter working middle class guy, I don't switch my iPhones very often (my android phones barely lasted me 9 months though). I do consider them extremely expensive, and I wouldn't go for one, unless I felt it was worth the money I was paying for it. I got this phone for INR 69,999/- from Amazon. With exchange offer, it cost me a little over 60K. For the price (and that price only), this makes it worth the buy.- It may not be the latest and greatest, but compared to iPhone XR, this is a much better package overall. Considering the XR is now priced higher than X. XS is only marginally better, and didn't feel it was worth the extra 30K.- Even after a year of being on the market, this phone is an absolute beast in terms of performance, especially after iOS 12.- The Camera is a beauty. You can't compare with DSLRs, but it is right up there with OnePlus and Google phones.- Looks exactly like the XS, and doesn't even have the S badging. The phone is extremely slippery. Invest in a good case, front screen protector and a rear glass protector- Such expensive phones should come with 128GB of storage as base, instead of 64GB. If you have the money, go for XS Max.- The battery isn't the best. Takes over two hours to fully charge from 5% to 100% even with the iPad charger. With moderate usage, you can get 8 hours barely.- With the price of the phone, should have at least come with the fast charger in the box.",

No matter how much you hate the design it seems this is quite an \"IN\" thing now for almost all phone manufacturers have started copying Apple. So all you detractors out there of Apple and the notch - take a chill pill :)!! Pros:1) A11 Bionic Processor is blazing fast and coupled with 3GB ram you will never have any issues with any of the heavy duty tasks you throw at it2) Screen resolution (Super retina HD) and the contrast ratio makes the viewing experience breathtaking3) Got the A1865 model ( iPhone X A1865 uses the Qualcomm MDM9655 Snapdragon X16 LTE modem while the iPhone X A1901 has the Intel XMM 7480 modem) which is better than the A1901 model as A1865 covers more cellular bands (GSM and CDMA networks and frequencies) and the performance of Qualcomm\u2019s chips has always been better than Intel\u2019s. LTE speeds and cellular receptions in case of weak signals also are a shade better than A1901.Cons:1) So recommend having a case around it (preferably a transparent one so that the beauty of the original phone can still be enjoyed!)2) I have to say that battery life is average - a shade better than iPhone 8.3)",

Well, absolutely yes.iPhone camera is not just better, it is so much better than comparing them are like comparing a Alto with BMW, yes both have 4 wheels, both have AC, both can run at 100 kmph, but you know the difference. The high price of iPhone is so justified by the sheer brilliance of camera it has. Sure it is just 12 MP, but the clarity, my o my!Sure the battery is just about 2600 compared to 3500 of a Redmi, but it lasts longer than a Redmi. My last iPhone was a 4S and then since I love buying phones every 6 months, I shifted to Android (Redmi, Samsung, Honor) to satiate my hunger for new phones. All these phones are superb, no doubt, but once you use the iPhone 7, you know that the difference between these phones and iPhone 6s has got much bigger because of the camera. Bottom line, iPhone 7 has jumped a big leap from the 6s and the 8 is almost similar. The X is double the price of a 7, so probably all things taken in account, the iPhone 7 is the best value for money among all phones in India",
