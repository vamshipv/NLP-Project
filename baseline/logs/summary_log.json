    "summary": "The Samsung Galaxy M01 Core generally receives positive feedback, highlighting its good build quality, performance, and camera features.  However, some users express disappointment with aspects like battery life, display clarity in low light conditions, and the lack of expandable storage. Certain users also experience occasional software issues like automatic restarts or limited camera functionality. Overall, the phone is considered a decent budget option, especially for those looking for a sleek design and good performance within their price range.  \n"

    "summary": "Customer feedback on the Samsung Galaxy M01 Core highlights a mix of positive and negative aspects:\n\n**Positives:** \n\n* **High praise for build quality, design, performance, camera (in good lighting), fast charging, user experience (Android and One UI)**\n* **Many enjoy the sleekness and convenience of the phone's size.**\n* **Positive experiences with display, sound quality,  and battery life are common.**\n* **Quick delivery from Amazon is appreciated.**\n\n**Negatives:**\n\n* **Battery life is a recurring concern**, even though it's considered a good performer in many reviews. \n* **Users often point to camera struggles in low light and occasional screen flickering/display quality issues.**  Some mention the \"auto-switching off\" feature as an issue, although this seems rare. \n* **Limited SD card slot and missing earphones in the box are mentioned as drawbacks.** \n\n**Overall:** The Samsung Galaxy M01 Core appears to be a well-received phone for its price point with several positive features but also some potential areas for improvement regarding battery life, camera performance, and user experience.  \n\n\nIt's worth noting that customer reviews can be subjective, and individual experiences may vary. \n"

    "summary": "Customers generally praise the Samsung Galaxy M01 Core for its excellent build quality, sleek design, and good camera performance (though it struggles with low light). Some note positive features like a large battery (6000 mAh), fast charging, and impressive display.  Concerns include occasional unexpected shutdowns, battery drain despite advertised capacity, and average overall performance compared to more expensive flagships like the OnePlus 7T.  Overall, the M01 Core appears to be a well-received budget option with some caveats for demanding users. \n"

    "summary": "The Samsung Galaxy M01 Core receives generally positive reviews, with users praising its build quality, design, camera (particularly for daylight shots), and fast updates.  However, some complaints include the battery life's inconsistency, occasional overheating, and mediocre display quality in low-light conditions.  Several reviewers highlight the improved performance compared to previous M series models. A notable point is that many users have experienced issues with the phone automatically switching off and on, although Samsung has addressed this. \n"

Good lighting conditions result in beautiful and detailed shots. Struggles a bit during the low light conditions. Overall quite ok for the price.4.\n- After 1 month Use1.Look and Build quality Good2. Camera Quality and feature mind blowing3. Battery 33w fast charger too good..charge 10 to 100% in just  40 to 45 minutes4. Ram management super.Good for multitasking...5. Display E3 Super Amoled,picture quality very nice stream any video in full HD like Amazon prime video, Netflix6. Audio output very clear and Loud7. Network Quality Good8. Lot of New AI feature provide in this phoneOverall This smartphone fulfill my all Technical Needs...Good work\n- Its not working. Pls don't buy this phone. Listen carefully, Only on August 14th 2020 I bought this, but today 23.08.2020 its not working. I couldn't even switch this mobile on. Samsung Galaxy M01 mobile. Mobile is not worth. As today I came to amazon for return or replacement this cheater has closed the return window by yesterday. How cunning they are ? not even ten days its been since I have bought. This cheaters have closed it. Its not working now. Even if I call toll free numbers no one responses.\n- The fault is from the end of Samsung company I suppose, because they should mention the process on the front page with bold letter. Most of the reviews which get 1 star facing the same problems like of mine. After using one month I want to add some extra points which impressed me.1. Sound quality and graphics are very good.2. Smooth touch sensitivity3. Ringtones are much louder.4.Two volte nano SIM s work fine together.5.Battery backup is good.\n- I received One Plus 7T 2 days back. I will describe you my experience in these 2 days.Firstly, kudos to Amazon for such a quick delivery and excellent packaging.Coming to the mobile, the first impression is just amazing. Its smooth, fast and you can't come out of it.The amoeld display is stunning and camera is amazing. Battery backup is also too good.\n- Video - Haven't really used much.Will update later3)Dolby speakers - Excellent sound quality with awesome stereo effect.Once again a huge upgrade over the older models.4)90 Hz refresh rate - Yes this one gives you a totally different experience when using your mobile.It is clearly faster and better than the usual 60Hz displays.5)Build and design - Just perfect...It's sleek...stylish and neat.\n- and i purchased this phone for my mom so quad core porcessor is sufficient to my mom.2:- Battry life is good because of Quad Core Processor.3:- Ram is 2Gb that is also sufficient4:- Display as always awesome as samsung provide.5:- Mike and Speaker's quality is too good as always samsung provide.6:- Many People said in the review that the mobile is automatically swiched off and on automatically. yes i have seen this my own only one time. but its not the problem.\n- Strongly recommend No..why samsung make lot advertise on m31s.really don't know wt makes new compared to other M series. 'Single take' shot option really useless.People who r looking for camera please don't buy m31s.All the modes camers pictures are 95%blur mode.perfomance of mobile is not up to expectations.When turns into selife mode really shocked IS IT HD photo or Asian paints colored WALL.REALLY SHOCKED.THIS TIME SAMSUNG DISAPPOINTED.Videos display is also not so effective.\n- (Using 8 GB ram variant)\u2206 WHAT'S INSIDE THE BOX \u2206The box looks like any other mobile phone box , nothing much fancy .Inside the box we get1) Device itself2)User manual and some paperwork.3)Dash charger and cable.\u2206 PROS\u22061) Design-It's a pro or con depending on each user's, if you look pass the Appleish design the build quality is amazing .It has curved back which feels really good when you hold it in hand.2)Top notch specs.3) Stock Android with minimal bloat and fast updates (I have received 3 till now)4)No-heating issues-I have used this device for many days and I must say this device barely heats up while doing intensive tasks, thanks to the Snapdragon 835.5) Excellent Camera-Day light photography is excellent but in low light it's a hit or a miss.6)Fast fingerprint scanner.\u2206CONS\u22061) Display is still Full hd2) Battery is not that great even with Full hd display (This could be fixed with an  software update)3)No Sd card slot.4) Price could have been less.Overall Iam pretty happy with the device and I highly recommend this to anyone over honor 8 pro.Thanks \u270c\ufe0f\n- Gifted it for my mother. It is perfect size , perfect placement of power and volume buttons, has dust on phone after opening the box but the box was sealed, same thing happened to me when I bought M31,Pros. * Perfect size* Samsung brand* Good build quality for this price* Android 10* One UI 2Cons. * camera is below average* Average display quality* No earphones in the box* No fingerprint scanner* Takes very long time to charge battery.Will update this review after few weeks.\n\n**Summary:**",
    "summary": "Customer feedback on the Samsung Galaxy M01 showcases a mixed bag of opinions.  Many praise its good build quality, performance (thanks to the Snapdragon 835 processor), and solid display. The camera, while decent in good light, struggles in low light conditions. Battery life is also a point of contention, with some users finding it underwhelming. While overall satisfaction is reported, concerns about display quality and battery longevity surface. However,  a general sentiment of positive reception emerges due to the phone's value for money proposition and its user-friendly Android experience. \n"

Some appreciate its ease of use, durability, good display, and solid performance for everyday tasks. There's also a general sentiment that this phone represents good value for money in the Indian market, especially against Chinese brands. \n\n**Negatives:** Concerns include slow charging time, camera quality not being as good as other phones in this price range, occasional automatic shutdowns, and inconsistent build quality (some experience issues with plastic body). Notably, some reviewers encounter difficulties using the phone after purchase.\n\n\nOverall, the Samsung Galaxy M01 is a decent budget option for those seeking a basic but reliable phone without sacrificing essential features. However, buyers should be aware of potential drawbacks and consider their individual needs before making a purchase.  \n"

Have all latest features like slow mo, 10x zoom, focus lens, panorma view and other added features.3. Battery ofcourse was the highlight while buying ths phn. I received this phn at 43%. And even after a rigorous 3 hr session of data transfer and apps installation it still holds at 33%.\n- Samsung trusted Knox security not fully enable on this phone i.e no secure folder option.7. When Sealed Package open then phone display contain so much dust. Not expected the packaging like this from brand like Samsung.8. Gorila Glass 3 protection under 25k i.e out dated glass protection after using 2 days with full care i got one scratch mark on display.9. NFC given but Samsung Pay not there in this phone.10.\n- Cons:_OverpricedBattery drain only fast in normal  uses give only  24 hours  backup.Sound quality  is so soBuild quality  is not goodPros:_Good processorGood  cameraUser interface  is goodFinger print sensor  working  very fast but some times missed out.After six days of uses, impressed  with camera performance, Display, fingerprint  working, and processor.Disappointed  with Battery  performance  my brother  realme 2 giving easily 2days battery  backup with 4250mah, but this phone is horrible in battery  backup  only  24 hours  with 7000.\n- At first glance it looks a bit bulky. Camera, display etc. are satisfactory.\n- There's something wrong with the new Samsung M51 mobile. Many other users are also facing the same issue. We are unable to connect through Wi-Fi on Samsung M51.Meanest Monster Ever ... HahahahaThis meanest monster is performing poorly within 5 min of unboxing. My eight yr old Lenovo still works like charm with Wi-Fi.Issue: When you trying connecting through Wi-Fi, on giving correct password, it says \"Incorrect Password\".I have done every troubleshooting step suggested by Samsung Tech support:1.\n- Audio output in my boat rockers bluetooth headset with this phone is not as much as lound as compare to my previous phone Redmi Note 7 pro.11. Without using phone it take 2 hour to charge but when you use it frequently then it take 2.30-3 hour to charged it full from 0-100%.12. Full battery drained in 12 hour with non stop used including youtube, whatsapp Facebook, messaging, etc except game.13.\n\n**Summary:**",
    "summary": "Customer feedback for the Samsung Galaxy M51 is mixed, highlighting both positives and negatives:\n\n**Positives:**\n\n* **Battery Life:**  Many users appreciate the long battery life (24 hours) with a 7000mAh capacity.\n* **Camera:** Users find the camera performance satisfactory, especially in good lighting conditions.\n* **Display & Fingerprint Scanner:** The display is praised for its quality, and the fingerprint scanner works quickly and accurately.\n* **Processor:**  Performance is generally good, handling multiple applications smoothly. \n\n**Negatives:**\n\n* **Build Quality and Design:**  Some complaints about the phone's bulky design and plastic back being prone to scratches. \n* **Overpriced:** Many feel the price-to-value ratio is poor compared to other phones in the market.\n* **Software/UI Issues:** The user interface, specifically for taking screenshots and access to certain settings, is criticized as needing improvement. \n* **Wi-Fi Connectivity**:  Users report difficulties connecting to Wi-Fi networks consistently.  \n* **Charging Time:** The charging time seems too slow at 2 hours for a full charge in standby mode, and even longer if using the phone actively. \n\n\n**Overall:** While there are positive aspects like battery life and camera performance, users are largely disappointed by the build quality, price, software shortcomings, and Wi-Fi connectivity issues.

I'm personally not a fan of notches nor do I click a lot of selfies, so I prefer the OnePlus 7T Pro's Fluid Display. Feels more luxurious over the 7T. It's marginally bigger to hold as well. I would recommend using a case so that the edges don't feel slippery.",
        "Loved the camera setup in OnePlus 7T but hated the circular bump.And I totally loved the edge display in OnePlus 7 pro.This device is just a perfect combination of the best features in the 7t and the 7pro and NOT an unwanted model like everyone is claiming.6) Batter and charging - The charging is blazing fast and the battery very easily lasts a whole day,even with 90Hz refresh rate.",

My experience so far with this:1. Display: It's amazing. Sharpness, brightness and 90Hz displays makes it one of the most beautiful displays.2. Camera: All of my previous mobiles had great cameras. 7t Pro is nothing less than that.",

Go for users reviews who bought them with their own money.",
        "This phone has great performance, good camera and ambiance. Charging is fast as per the Oneplus standards set in earlier phones.

        "Maybe their R&D or trials have some problem here that in every two months they are launching a new device with an update to the previous faults. Like OnePlus 7 has voice receiver on one side which is right. So if you take calls or hear the phone from left you won't get a clear voice or volume. So they added receivers on both the side in this device.I am still not getting why I have spent Rs 40,000 on it.",
        "However, you should also note that in different lighting conditions, 7T Pro has glares at the curves due to the rounder corners which I believe is negligible. 90Hz is smoooooth.

You can't take screenshot easily.",

Seamless fingerprint scanner. I hv heard tht recent samsung phns have ths issue , however i dnt see any in ths phn. Its as gud as my past phns Asus 6z and Vivo v15pro. Side fingerprint scanner on the power button really makes it stylish and too easy to handle as well.2.",
        "I am giving this review after spending 20 days with this Phone. I am a retail user and after 6 year of redmi and realme user now buy the Samsung just because of Samsung+Snapdragon and very much dispointed. Here are some Pros and Cons which will help other user like me to decide whether they will buy it or not.Cons :1. No Haptic Feedback2. Low sound quality speaker at Rs 25K3. No apps lock features inbuilt4. No Case Cover in Box5. Plain Plastic back design at 25K which attract too much scratches.6.",
        "I found it reliable for my 1920p to 4k level of movie watching without any distraction due to Infinite O display which gives Full Screen Ratio. Fingerprint on side is much faster than I expected. It doesn't takes a second also to open. Even FaceUnlock is faster.Superior, as it matches any S series flagship premium in classy look, strong built for this budget amount. 6.7 inches display is good to handle as it is well managed for one hand use also.",

Wonderful touch and a decent processimg speed. I tried playing 7-8 apps at the same time and it never hanged or lagged despite 50% memory up. Yet to try on heavy games though.6. Front cam does spoil the fun while watching full screen videos, like a small black dot bt can be lived wth.7. No headphones in the box.8.",

But this easy method for taking screenshot is not easy to find in its setting section. Automatic redial isn't available. also in setting section, searching for basic operation like redial, call waiting etc are either missing or very difficult to access.

You can't take screenshot easily.\n- In this price segment, Samsung can easily provide metallic back for better appearance and transfer of heat.Overall, its good non chini phone with good camera and display, a bit bulky, satisfactory speed, scope of tremendous improvement in UI and setting, and bit overpriced.\n- When you focus on Sky whole pic turn into blue. i.e saturation level is too much high in this phone (Image attached).16. While watching movie video in this phone or playing video in youtube brightness fluctuate fast too much automatically i.e Adaptive Brightness issue.Pros :1. Super amoled plus display2. Camera quality Good3. 7000 Mah battery4.\n- No Carrier aggregation: Using Jio sim in Samsung M51 and realme X2 pro and both contain different net speed in which Samsung giving me 5mbps and realme x2 pro giving me 9-10mbps.14. Calling issue: while talking through ear piece on call, the person can hear my voice clearly. But if i put the call on loudspeaker, the receiver of call cant hear my voice or he hear my sound very low. Turning back to earpiece the person is able to hear me again.15. Camera Zoom quality is not good.\n- Awesome camera Awesome battery Awesome display  ....Super clear ZoomSuper Macro sensorSuper ultrawide angleAtlast Thanks Samsung for 730G\n- Ok so here comes the first review of this phone. Ordered on the first day of its sale and received on 3rd day. Indeed its a big and bulky phn but easy to handle. Few highlights:1. Seamless fingerprint scanner. I hv heard tht recent samsung phns have ths issue , however i dnt see any in ths phn. Its as gud as my past phns Asus 6z and Vivo v15pro. Side fingerprint scanner on the power button really makes it stylish and too easy to handle as well.2.\n- I am giving this review after spending 20 days with this Phone. I am a retail user and after 6 year of redmi and realme user now buy the Samsung just because of Samsung+Snapdragon and very much dispointed. Here are some Pros and Cons which will help other user like me to decide whether they will buy it or not.Cons :1. No Haptic Feedback2. Low sound quality speaker at Rs 25K3. No apps lock features inbuilt4. No Case Cover in Box5. Plain Plastic back design at 25K which attract too much scratches.6.\n- I found it reliable for my 1920p to 4k level of movie watching without any distraction due to Infinite O display which gives Full Screen Ratio. Fingerprint on side is much faster than I expected. It doesn't takes a second also to open. Even FaceUnlock is faster.Superior, as it matches any S series flagship premium in classy look, strong built for this budget amount. 6.7 inches display is good to handle as it is well managed for one hand use also.\n- This is a perfect mobile for you,1. If you properly read the spec before buying this mobile2. If you don't expect all iPhone features in this mobile,3. if you are not a addictive gamer,4. If you don't expect your mobile to be a speaker,5. If you do concern about your data handled in Chinese mobiles,6. If you need better SAR value,7. If your first preference is battery, and decent level of camera quality,8.\n- Camera quality is really gud wth many features which luks tempting which im yet to explore. Even in dim light it scores quite well. Have all latest features like slow mo, 10x zoom, focus lens, panorma view and other added features.3. Battery ofcourse was the highlight while buying ths phn. I received this phn at 43%. And even after a rigorous 3 hr session of data transfer and apps installation it still holds at 33%.\n- At first glance it looks a bit bulky. Camera, display etc. are satisfactory.\n- I believe it gonna last 2 days easily wth heavy net usage , mild games and gud 2 hrs of talk time.4. Luks wise it does seem premium despite a plastic back.5. Wonderful touch and a decent processimg speed. I tried playing 7-8 apps at the same time and it never hanged or lagged despite 50% memory up. Yet to try on heavy games though.6. Front cam does spoil the fun while watching full screen videos, like a small black dot bt can be lived wth.7. No headphones in the box.8.\n- You need to learn fine motor coordination between your fingers and power&volume button with microsecond precision. After three days I discovered taking screenshot by swapping screen. But this easy method for taking screenshot is not easy to find in its setting section. Automatic redial isn't available. also in setting section, searching for basic operation like redial, call waiting etc are either missing or very difficult to access. UI should be more intelligent and intuitive.\n- Cons:_OverpricedBattery drain only fast in normal  uses give only  24 hours  backup.Sound quality  is so soBuild quality  is not goodPros:_Good processorGood  cameraUser interface  is goodFinger print sensor  working  very fast but some times missed out.After six days of uses, impressed  with camera performance, Display, fingerprint  working, and processor.Disappointed  with Battery  performance  my brother  realme 2 giving easily 2days battery  backup with 4250mah, but this phone is horrible in battery  backup  only  24 hours  with 7000.\n- It has issue with camera in night mode and pro mode.It seems like there is dust present on camera sensor which is only visible in dark photos. When photo is clicked with lens covered completely,  it shows hundreds of white spots in image, same happens with pro mode too.

    "summary": "The Samsung Galaxy M51 receives mixed feedback from users. \n\n**Positives:**\n\n* **Camera quality is good** with attractive features, including macro and ultra-wide lens.\n* **Battery life is strong,** offering decent runtime even with heavy usage.\n* **Display quality is excellent,** with a vivid Super Amoled Plus display for viewing movies and multimedia content.\n* **Fingerprint scanner is fast and convenient**,  and the phone generally feels well-made for its price point. \n\n**Negatives:**\n\n* **Wi-Fi connectivity is frequently unreliable.** Many users report issues connecting to Wi-Fi networks, which detracts from a smooth user experience.\n* **Software performance has been criticized**, with complaints about UI complexity, lag, and frequent app crashes. The camera also suffers in low-light situations. \n* **Build quality feels average** with many noting the plastic back is prone to scratches.  Battery drain is also a significant issue for some users, especially when compared to competitors.\n* **User interface is a point of contention.** Some find the UI difficult and slow, with limited accessibility options.\n\n\nOverall, the Samsung Galaxy M51 offers a strong camera, good battery life, and fast fingerprint scanner at a competitive price.  However, Wi-Fi connectivity issues, performance complaints, and inconsistent build quality leave room for improvement. \n"

Now in M51 feature of Widevine L Certification you can enjoy all those global Dolby theatre experience.\n- Genuine Feedback to samsung and all buyersNot Upto the Mark..Battery is good, but mobile is very heavy.. not handy for one hand operation.. if you use it continuously then you feel pain in your  hand, designed is out dated, poor quality material.. camera is just okay..I am not happy overall performance of this phone at this price band...Mobile should be perfect for 15-16k price band..Lookwise not goodDisplay qaulity is just good not bestSound quality is goodCamera not much good that I am expecting.Big screen which perfect for movie watcher.. but after 30 minutes you feel pain in your hands.I bought Electric blue colour, it's look like samsung old samrt phone .My request to Amazon, is it possible to return this mobile.\n- Overall GOOD non Chinese phone.However, for their improvement, I tried to give some critical feedback to the company over phone but it was not so easy, so, I am writing here sothat Samsung India can take this critical review for their improvement.Battery:Battery is 7K mha but it is draining so fast that its overall backup time is slightly better than any other average phone.User Interface:User interface needs tremendous improvement. You can't take screenshot easily.\n- In this price segment, Samsung can easily provide metallic back for better appearance and transfer of heat.Overall, its good non chini phone with good camera and display, a bit bulky, satisfactory speed, scope of tremendous improvement in UI and setting, and bit overpriced.\n- When you focus on Sky whole pic turn into blue. i.e saturation level is too much high in this phone (Image attached).16. While watching movie video in this phone or playing video in youtube brightness fluctuate fast too much automatically i.e Adaptive Brightness issue.Pros :1. Super amoled plus display2. Camera quality Good3. 7000 Mah battery4.\n- No Carrier aggregation: Using Jio sim in Samsung M51 and realme X2 pro and both contain different net speed in which Samsung giving me 5mbps and realme x2 pro giving me 9-10mbps.14. Calling issue: while talking through ear piece on call, the person can hear my voice clearly. But if i put the call on loudspeaker, the receiver of call cant hear my voice or he hear my sound very low. Turning back to earpiece the person is able to hear me again.15. Camera Zoom quality is not good.\n- Awesome camera Awesome battery Awesome display  ....Super clear ZoomSuper Macro sensorSuper ultrawide angleAtlast Thanks Samsung for 730G\n- Ok so here comes the first review of this phone. Ordered on the first day of its sale and received on 3rd day. Indeed its a big and bulky phn but easy to handle. Few highlights:1. Seamless fingerprint scanner. I hv heard tht recent samsung phns have ths issue , however i dnt see any in ths phn. Its as gud as my past phns Asus 6z and Vivo v15pro. Side fingerprint scanner on the power button really makes it stylish and too easy to handle as well.2.\n- I am giving this review after spending 20 days with this Phone. I am a retail user and after 6 year of redmi and realme user now buy the Samsung just because of Samsung+Snapdragon and very much dispointed. Here are some Pros and Cons which will help other user like me to decide whether they will buy it or not.Cons :1. No Haptic Feedback2. Low sound quality speaker at Rs 25K3. No apps lock features inbuilt4. No Case Cover in Box5. Plain Plastic back design at 25K which attract too much scratches.6.\n- I found it reliable for my 1920p to 4k level of movie watching without any distraction due to Infinite O display which gives Full Screen Ratio. Fingerprint on side is much faster than I expected. It doesn't takes a second also to open. Even FaceUnlock is faster.Superior, as it matches any S series flagship premium in classy look, strong built for this budget amount. 6.7 inches display is good to handle as it is well managed for one hand use also.\n- This is a perfect mobile for you,1. If you properly read the spec before buying this mobile2. If you don't expect all iPhone features in this mobile,3. if you are not a addictive gamer,4. If you don't expect your mobile to be a speaker,5. If you do concern about your data handled in Chinese mobiles,6. If you need better SAR value,7. If your first preference is battery, and decent level of camera quality,8.\n- Camera quality is really gud wth many features which luks tempting which im yet to explore. Even in dim light it scores quite well. Have all latest features like slow mo, 10x zoom, focus lens, panorma view and other added features.3. Battery ofcourse was the highlight while buying ths phn. I received this phn at 43%. And even after a rigorous 3 hr session of data transfer and apps installation it still holds at 33%.\n- At first glance it looks a bit bulky. Camera, display etc. are satisfactory.\n- I believe it gonna last 2 days easily wth heavy net usage , mild games and gud 2 hrs of talk time.4. Luks wise it does seem premium despite a plastic back.5. Wonderful touch and a decent processimg speed. I tried playing 7-8 apps at the same time and it never hanged or lagged despite 50% memory up. Yet to try on heavy games though.6. Front cam does spoil the fun while watching full screen videos, like a small black dot bt can be lived wth.7. No headphones in the box.8.\n- You need to learn fine motor coordination between your fingers and power&volume button with microsecond precision. After three days I discovered taking screenshot by swapping screen. But this easy method for taking screenshot is not easy to find in its setting section. Automatic redial isn't available. also in setting section, searching for basic operation like redial, call waiting etc are either missing or very difficult to access. UI should be more intelligent and intuitive.\n- Cons:_OverpricedBattery drain only fast in normal  uses give only  24 hours  backup.Sound quality  is so soBuild quality  is not goodPros:_Good processorGood  cameraUser interface  is goodFinger print sensor  working  very fast but some times missed out.After six days of uses, impressed  with camera performance, Display, fingerprint  working, and processor.Disappointed  with Battery  performance  my brother  realme 2 giving easily 2days battery  backup with 4250mah, but this phone is horrible in battery  backup  only  24 hours  with 7000.\n- It has issue with camera in night mode and pro mode.It seems like there is dust present on camera sensor which is only visible in dark photos.

    "summary": "Customer feedback on the Samsung Galaxy M51 is mixed. While there are positive aspects like impressive camera quality, a large screen (good for movies), and decent battery life, several issues arise:\n\n* **Wi-Fi connectivity problems:** Many users report Wi-Fi connection issues.\n* **Battery drain:** Battery life is criticized as being insufficient, even with moderate usage. \n* **Performance:** Some users find the phone to be slow and laggy even after multitasking.  \n* **User interface:** Some find the user interface frustrating, lacking intuitive features and clear navigation. \n* **Camera performance:** Camera functionality isn't universally praised; night mode and professional modes are reported to have issues.\n\n\nIn conclusion, while the M51 has some redeeming qualities, it suffers from significant drawbacks that leave users dissatisfied with the overall experience and pricing.  Repair options for faulty hardware are available through Samsung service centers but require a trip to a repair center rather than an at-home fix. \n"

Some find it bulky, the plastic back prone to scratches, and the lack of a headphone jack frustrating.\n* **Battery drain is an issue** for some, leading to a shorter battery life compared to competitors. \n* **User interface shortcomings**:  Several users mention difficulty finding specific functions like redial and screenshot options in the settings menu, highlighting a need for improvement.  \n* **Camera performance in low-light and pro mode appears inconsistent**, with dust on the sensor being an identified issue.\n\n\n**In short:** The Samsung Galaxy M51 offers strong points in display, camera, and battery life. However, connectivity problems, design flaws, inconsistent app"

Now in M51 feature of Widevine L Certification you can enjoy all those global Dolby theatre experience.\n- Genuine Feedback to samsung and all buyersNot Upto the Mark..Battery is good, but mobile is very heavy.. not handy for one hand operation.. if you use it continuously then you feel pain in your  hand, designed is out dated, poor quality material.. camera is just okay..I am not happy overall performance of this phone at this price band...Mobile should be perfect for 15-16k price band..Lookwise not goodDisplay qaulity is just good not bestSound quality is goodCamera not much good that I am expecting.Big screen which perfect for movie watcher.. but after 30 minutes you feel pain in your hands.I bought Electric blue colour, it's look like samsung old samrt phone .My request to Amazon, is it possible to return this mobile.\n- Overall GOOD non Chinese phone.However, for their improvement, I tried to give some critical feedback to the company over phone but it was not so easy, so, I am writing here sothat Samsung India can take this critical review for their improvement.Battery:Battery is 7K mha but it is draining so fast that its overall backup time is slightly better than any other average phone.User Interface:User interface needs tremendous improvement. You can't take screenshot easily.\n- In this price segment, Samsung can easily provide metallic back for better appearance and transfer of heat.Overall, its good non chini phone with good camera and display, a bit bulky, satisfactory speed, scope of tremendous improvement in UI and setting, and bit overpriced.\n- When you focus on Sky whole pic turn into blue. i.e saturation level is too much high in this phone (Image attached).16. While watching movie video in this phone or playing video in youtube brightness fluctuate fast too much automatically i.e Adaptive Brightness issue.Pros :1. Super amoled plus display2.

Calling issue: while talking through ear piece on call, the person can hear my voice clearly. But if i put the call on loudspeaker, the receiver of call cant hear my voice or he hear my sound very low. Turning back to earpiece the person is able to hear me again.15. Camera Zoom quality is not good.\n- Awesome camera Awesome battery Awesome display  ....Super clear ZoomSuper Macro sensorSuper ultrawide angleAtlast Thanks Samsung for 730G\n- Ok so here comes the first review of this phone. Ordered on the first day of its sale and received on 3rd day. Indeed its a big and bulky phn but easy to handle. Few highlights:1. Seamless fingerprint scanner. I hv heard tht recent samsung phns have ths issue , however i dnt see any in ths phn. Its as gud as my past phns Asus 6z and Vivo v15pro. Side fingerprint scanner on the power button really makes it stylish and too easy to handle as well.2.\n- I am giving this review after spending 20 days with this Phone. I am a retail user and after 6 year of redmi and realme user now buy the Samsung just because of Samsung+Snapdragon and very much dispointed. Here are some Pros and Cons which will help other user like me to decide whether they will buy it or not.Cons :1. No Haptic Feedback2. Low sound quality speaker at Rs 25K3. No apps lock features inbuilt4. No Case Cover in Box5. Plain Plastic back design at 25K which attract too much scratches.6.\n- I found it reliable for my 1920p to 4k level of movie watching without any distraction due to Infinite O display which gives Full Screen Ratio. Fingerprint on side is much faster than I expected. It doesn't takes a second also to open. Even FaceUnlock is faster.Superior, as it matches any S series flagship premium in classy look, strong built for this budget amount. 6.7 inches display is good to handle as it is well managed for one hand use also.\n- This is a perfect mobile for you,1. If you properly read the spec before buying this mobile2. If you don't expect all iPhone features in this mobile,3. if you are not a addictive gamer,4. If you don't expect your mobile to be a speaker,5. If you do concern about your data handled in Chinese mobiles,6. If you need better SAR value,7. If your first preference is battery, and decent level of camera quality,8.\n- Camera quality is really gud wth many features which luks tempting which im yet to explore. Even in dim light it scores quite well. Have all latest features like slow mo, 10x zoom, focus lens, panorma view and other added features.3. Battery ofcourse was the highlight while buying ths phn. I received this phn at 43%. And even after a rigorous 3 hr session of data transfer and apps installation it still holds at 33%.\n- At first glance it looks a bit bulky. Camera, display etc. are satisfactory.\n- I believe it gonna last 2 days easily wth heavy net usage , mild games and gud 2 hrs of talk time.4. Luks wise it does seem premium despite a plastic back.5. Wonderful touch and a decent processimg speed. I tried playing 7-8 apps at the same time and it never hanged or lagged despite 50% memory up. Yet to try on heavy games though.6. Front cam does spoil the fun while watching full screen videos, like a small black dot bt can be lived wth.7. No headphones in the box.8.\n- You need to learn fine motor coordination between your fingers and power&volume button with microsecond precision. After three days I discovered taking screenshot by swapping screen. But this easy method for taking screenshot is not easy to find in its setting section. Automatic redial isn't available. also in setting section, searching for basic operation like redial, call waiting etc are either missing or very difficult to access. UI should be more intelligent and intuitive.\n- Cons:_OverpricedBattery drain only fast in normal  uses give only  24 hours  backup.Sound quality  is so soBuild quality  is not goodPros:_Good processorGood  cameraUser interface  is goodFinger print sensor  working  very fast but some times missed out.After six days of uses, impressed  with camera performance, Display, fingerprint  working, and processor.Disappointed  with Battery  performance  my brother  realme 2 giving easily 2days battery  backup with 4250mah, but this phone is horrible in battery  backup  only  24 hours  with 7000.\n- It has issue with camera in night mode and pro mode.It seems like there is dust present on camera sensor which is only visible in dark photos. When photo is clicked with lens covered completely,  it shows hundreds of white spots in image, same happens with pro mode too. (This is not regular image noise)\n- Factory Data ResetI have applied every step suggested by tech-support and the result is still the same.The most irritating thing is how can a company like Samsung mess-up such a basic feature & to the surprise, even the tech support has now run out of troubleshooting solutions.Instead of replacing it with new phone, tech support has now told me to get the hardware fixed from Samsung Service centre. I don't get it why should I take a brand new phone to service center & get it opened.\n\n**Summary:**",

A few highlight concerns include **app freezing**, \"**missed calls due to low volume\"** and **\"difficulty taking screenshots\".** Overall, there is an expectation that the phone's price point doesn't justify its shortcomings, particularly for users coming from lower-priced brands. \n"

    "summary": "Customer feedback for the Samsung Galaxy M51 reveals mixed opinions on its performance and features. \n\n**Positives:** Many appreciate the camera quality, especially in low-light conditions, with some highlighting the super AMOLED display's clarity.  The battery life is also lauded. The fingerprint scanner is frequently praised as fast and reliable, while the phone generally performs well for everyday tasks, even multitasking. \n\n**Negatives:** A significant portion of users express disappointment with Wi-Fi connectivity issues and general performance. Complaints about camera performance in night mode and pro mode highlight technical flaws.  Battery life falls short of expectations, and there is concern regarding sound quality. The user interface has faced criticism for its lack of intuitiveness, particularly in terms of screenshots and redial functions.   Some find the phone bulky and overpriced for its specifications, while others appreciate Samsung's effort on premium design at an affordable price point. \n\n\n**Overall:** Users are divided between positive aspects and significant shortcomings.  There is a clear call for improvement across various features, including Wi-Fi connectivity, camera functionality in certain modes, and user interface streamlining. \n"

Even FaceUnlock is faster.Superior, as it matches any S series flagship premium in classy look, strong built for this budget amount. 6.7 inches display is good to handle as it is well managed for one hand use also.\n- This is a perfect mobile for you,1. If you properly read the spec before buying this mobile2. If you don't expect all iPhone features in this mobile,3. if you are not a addictive gamer,4. If you don't expect your mobile to be a speaker,5. If you do concern about your data handled in Chinese mobiles,6. If you need better SAR value,7. If your first preference is battery, and decent level of camera quality,8.\n- Camera quality is really gud wth many features which luks tempting which im yet to explore. Even in dim light it scores quite well. Have all latest features like slow mo, 10x zoom, focus lens, panorma view and other added features.3. Battery ofcourse was the highlight while buying ths phn. I received this phn at 43%. And even after a rigorous 3 hr session of data transfer and apps installation it still holds at 33%.\n- At first glance it looks a bit bulky. Camera, display etc. are satisfactory.\n- I believe it gonna last 2 days easily wth heavy net usage , mild games and gud 2 hrs of talk time.4. Luks wise it does seem premium despite a plastic back.5. Wonderful touch and a decent processimg speed. I tried playing 7-8 apps at the same time and it never hanged or lagged despite 50% memory up. Yet to try on heavy games though.6. Front cam does spoil the fun while watching full screen videos, like a small black dot bt can be lived wth.7. No headphones in the box.8.\n- You need to learn fine motor coordination between your fingers and power&volume button with microsecond precision. After three days I discovered taking screenshot by swapping screen. But this easy method for taking screenshot is not easy to find in its setting section. Automatic redial isn't available. also in setting section, searching for basic operation like redial, call waiting etc are either missing or very difficult to access. UI should be more intelligent and intuitive.\n- Cons:_OverpricedBattery drain only fast in normal  uses give only  24 hours  backup.Sound quality  is so soBuild quality  is not goodPros:_Good processorGood  cameraUser interface  is goodFinger print sensor  working  very fast but some times missed out.After six days of uses, impressed  with camera performance, Display, fingerprint  working, and processor.Disappointed  with Battery  performance  my brother  realme 2 giving easily 2days battery  backup with 4250mah, but this phone is horrible in battery  backup  only  24 hours  with 7000.\n- It has issue with camera in night mode and pro mode.It seems like there is dust present on camera sensor which is only visible in dark photos. When photo is clicked with lens covered completely,  it shows hundreds of white spots in image, same happens with pro mode too. (This is not regular image noise)\n- Factory Data ResetI have applied every step suggested by tech-support and the result is still the same.The most irritating thing is how can a company like Samsung mess-up such a basic feature & to the surprise, even the tech support has now run out of troubleshooting solutions.Instead of replacing it with new phone, tech support has now told me to get the hardware fixed from Samsung Service centre. I don't get it why should I take a brand new phone to service center & get it opened.\n\n**Summary:**",
    "summary": "Customer feedback on the Samsung Galaxy M51 is mixed.  While some highlight its **good camera, large display, and long battery life**, others express concerns about **performance issues (Wi-Fi connectivity, call quality), design flaws (plastic back, lack of headphone jack), and software shortcomings (UI complexity, missing features)**.  \n\n**Common complaints include:**\n\n* **Weak Wi-Fi connection:** Many users encounter persistent connection problems.\n* **Poor performance in some areas:** Some find the phone lags when multitasking or experiencing high data usage. \n* **Heavy weight and uncomfortable grip:** Some users find the phone bulky and difficult to hold for extended periods, especially while one-handed operation.\n* **Inconsistent app redial function:**  The automatic redial feature is either missing or inaccessible in some situations. \n* **Camera issues in specific modes:** Night mode and pro mode exhibit problems with dust affecting image quality.\n\n\nOverall, customers find the phone to be a decent value for money, particularly for its battery life and camera capabilities. However, there's a clear consensus that Samsung needs to address software and design flaws to improve overall user experience and justify the higher price point. \n"

    "summary": "The Samsung Galaxy M51 is generally considered average in terms of performance, with some users experiencing issues like Wi-Fi connectivity problems and battery drainage. Many appreciate the large display, camera features (including macro and zoom), and overall design, but criticisms focus on pricing, bulky build, lack of certain features (like haptic feedback or app lock), and potential data security concerns regarding Chinese components.  Overall, it seems there's a mixed bag of opinions with some positive aspects outweighing the negative points for many users. \n"

I'm personally not a fan of notches nor do I click a lot of selfies, so I prefer the OnePlus 7T Pro's Fluid Display. Feels more luxurious over the 7T. It's marginally bigger to hold as well. I would recommend using a case so that the edges don't feel slippery.",
        "No camera quality, no battery life, no sound quality on calls, getting wounds on holding it for long.I have always recommended OnePlus devices to everyone around and had high hopes and trust on the brand that I bought it on the day of the launch but with this experience, I won't recommend OnePlus 7t to my colleagues and friends who are planning to upgrade their devices.",

        "Amazing phone with an unbelievably smooth and vivid display.I had been using the OnePlus 5T before and a big fan of OnePlus cameras and OS.But I've always felt the OnePlus display wasn't good enough.This mobile just killed that thought.Highlights:1)Buttery smooth, fast and bright display -The edge display is just wowwww. You just can't stop admiring it.2)Excellent camera - The pictures come out so well in all kinds of lighting and modes.",
        "I received One Plus 7T 2 days back. I will describe you my experience in these 2 days.Firstly, kudos to Amazon for such a quick delivery and excellent packaging.Coming to the mobile, the first impression is just amazing. Its smooth, fast and you can't come out of it.The amoeld display is stunning and camera is amazing. Battery backup is also too good.",
        "However, you should also note that in different lighting conditions, 7T Pro has glares at the curves due to the rounder corners which I believe is negligible. 90Hz is smoooooth. You would never want to get back to 60Hz once you're used to this.==== Performance ====Snapdragon 855 Plus is one of the best CPUs out there (at the time of writing this review) and with Adrena 640, it takes gaming and multi-tasking to another league. COD & PUB-G juices out at their best with 60FPS & is indeed smooth than imagined."

    "summary": "The OnePlus 7T Pro generally receives positive feedback for its display, camera quality, fast charging, and overall performance. Some users experience issues with battery life and occasional software glitches. There is a general consensus that the phone offers a significant upgrade over previous models and is particularly well-suited for those seeking a flagship-level device with minimal notches. However, some criticisms highlight potential drawbacks like screen glare in specific lighting conditions, a slight drop in battery life compared to expectations, and issues with notification management on certain devices.  \n"

    "summary": "The OnePlus 7T Pro generally receives positive reviews, particularly for its display (which boasts a vibrant 90Hz refresh rate), camera quality, and fast charging capabilities. However, some users report issues with software performance and battery life, with complaints of heating problems and inconsistent notifications. Some mention the phone feels slippery compared to previous models, but appreciate the slimmer design and the overall smooth user experience.  A few reviews note that while this is an incremental upgrade over the 7 Pro, it might be worth considering the 7 Pro for those seeking better value or a more seamless experience before committing to the 7T Pro's newer features. Overall, there are both positive and negative aspects, with users finding the phone's performance to be excellent in terms of its speed, graphics, and camera quality.  \n"

Seamless fingerprint scanner. I hv heard tht recent samsung phns have ths issue , however i dnt see any in ths phn. Its as gud as my past phns Asus 6z and Vivo v15pro. Side fingerprint scanner on the power button really makes it stylish and too easy to handle as well.2.",
        "I am giving this review after spending 20 days with this Phone. I am a retail user and after 6 year of redmi and realme user now buy the Samsung just because of Samsung+Snapdragon and very much dispointed. Here are some Pros and Cons which will help other user like me to decide whether they will buy it or not.Cons :1. No Haptic Feedback2. Low sound quality speaker at Rs 25K3. No apps lock features inbuilt4. No Case Cover in Box5. Plain Plastic back design at 25K which attract too much scratches.6.",
        "I found it reliable for my 1920p to 4k level of movie watching without any distraction due to Infinite O display which gives Full Screen Ratio. Fingerprint on side is much faster than I expected. It doesn't takes a second also to open. Even FaceUnlock is faster.Superior, as it matches any S series flagship premium in classy look, strong built for this budget amount. 6.7 inches display is good to handle as it is well managed for one hand use also.",

If your first preference is battery, and decent level of camera quality,8.",

Have all latest features like slow mo, 10x zoom, focus lens, panorma view and other added features.3. Battery ofcourse was the highlight while buying ths phn. I received this phn at 43%. And even after a rigorous 3 hr session of data transfer and apps installation it still holds at 33%.",

Camera Zoom quality is not good.\n- Awesome camera Awesome battery Awesome display  ....Super clear ZoomSuper Macro sensorSuper ultrawide angleAtlast Thanks Samsung for 730G\n- Ok so here comes the first review of this phone. Ordered on the first day of its sale and received on 3rd day. Indeed its a big and bulky phn but easy to handle. Few highlights:1. Seamless fingerprint scanner. I hv heard tht recent samsung phns have ths issue , however i dnt see any in ths phn. Its as gud as my past phns Asus 6z and Vivo v15pro. Side fingerprint scanner on the power button really makes it stylish and too easy to handle as well.2.\n- I am giving this review after spending 20 days with this Phone. I am a retail user and after 6 year of redmi and realme user now buy the Samsung just because of Samsung+Snapdragon and very much dispointed. Here are some Pros and Cons which will help other user like me to decide whether they will buy it or not.Cons :1. No Haptic Feedback2. Low sound quality speaker at Rs 25K3. No apps lock features inbuilt4. No Case Cover in Box5. Plain Plastic back design at 25K which attract too much scratches.6.\n- I found it reliable for my 1920p to 4k level of movie watching without any distraction due to Infinite O display which gives Full Screen Ratio. Fingerprint on side is much faster than I expected. It doesn't takes a second also to open. Even FaceUnlock is faster.Superior, as it matches any S series flagship premium in classy look, strong built for this budget amount. 6.7 inches display is good to handle as it is well managed for one hand use also.\n- This is a perfect mobile for you,1. If you properly read the spec before buying this mobile2. If you don't expect all iPhone features in this mobile,3. if you are not a addictive gamer,4. If you don't expect your mobile to be a speaker,5. If you do concern about your data handled in Chinese mobiles,6. If you need better SAR value,7. If your first preference is battery, and decent level of camera quality,8.\n- Camera quality is really gud wth many features which luks tempting which im yet to explore. Even in dim light it scores quite well. Have all latest features like slow mo, 10x zoom, focus lens, panorma view and other added features.3. Battery ofcourse was the highlight while buying ths phn. I received this phn at 43%. And even after a rigorous 3 hr session of data transfer and apps installation it still holds at 33%.\n- At first glance it looks a bit bulky. Camera, display etc. are satisfactory.\n\n**Summary:**",
    "summary": "The Samsung Galaxy M51 is generally considered average, with mixed reviews regarding its performance and features. Some users praise the camera, battery life, and display quality.  However, many complain about Wi-Fi connectivity issues, a heavy design that's difficult to handle for one hand use, and inconsistent app/voice call clarity, along with underwhelming speed in comparison to other competitors. Overall, while some find it appealing due to its features, the price point is considered high compared to similar devices offering better value for money. \n"

Some express disappointment with the phone's price point considering the perceived limitations, while others highlight the high-quality speakers and fingerprint scanner. Overall, the M51 offers a balanced package but falls short in some areas compared to competitors.  \n"

    "summary": "Customer feedback on the Samsung Galaxy M51 reveals mixed opinions regarding its performance and value for money.  Many praise the camera (particularly in low light), battery life, and display quality. However, users report Wi-Fi connectivity issues and voice call clarity problems. Some criticize its design, bulky size, lack of haptic feedback, and no app lock features. The overall consensus is that it offers decent features at a competitive price but might not be a perfect choice for everyone. \n"

    "summary": "Customers express mixed opinions about the Samsung Galaxy M51. Some highlight its positive aspects:\n\n* **Camera**:  The camera performs well with appealing features like 64MP sensor, macro, and ultrawide angle. It's praised for quality in various lighting conditions.\n* **Display**: The Super AMOLED display is a major selling point, offering vivid colors and a wide viewing angle.  \n* **Battery**: Long battery life (7000 mAh) with good performance even during heavy usage. \n* **Design**: The phone's size is mentioned as an advantage for one-handed use.\n\nHowever, several criticisms exist:\n\n* **Software and Performance:** Issues reported include slow processing speed and problems with Wi-Fi connectivity, user interface, and app lock features.\n* **Cost & Value**: Many find the price to be overpriced considering its performance.  A few have encountered software glitches or performance issues.  \n* **Build Quality**: Some feel the build quality is lacking, noting a bulky design and flimsy plastic back. \n* **Other:** Concerns about network speeds, call audio quality (especially with loudspeakers),  and lack of haptic feedback are mentioned.\n\n\nOverall, while the Samsung Galaxy M51 boasts impressive specs and camera capabilities, it's ultimately viewed as underwhelming by many users due to its pricing, performance shortcomings, and build quality inconsistencies. \n"

However, some users express dissatisfaction with features like automatic redial, UI accessibility, and slow speed of Wi-Fi connectivity on the device. Certain users note issues with camera performance in low light and night mode, and also mention a perceived lack of durability due to a plastic back design.  Complaints regarding sound quality and battery life are also present in several reviews. Some reviewers highlight a notable absence of features like app lock and headphones. \n"

    "summary": "Users generally praise the M51's camera quality, particularly its impressive low-light performance and macro capabilities.  Some find the wide range of features like slow motion, 10x zoom, and panorama view appealing. The display is highly rated for its clarity and screen size. However, some users express disappointment with battery life, citing limited runtime even during moderate usage. Others note issues with camera performance in night mode and pro mode, suggesting potential sensor problems.  Some also report difficulties with the user interface, particularly when attempting to access basic functions like redial or call waiting. \n"

    "summary": "Users frequently praise the Samsung Galaxy M51's camera for its excellent features and performance, including a 64-megapixel sensor with a macro and ultrawide angle capabilities.  Some users note the phone has an impressive display, but it may be too heavy and uncomfortable to hold for long periods of time, making one-handed operation challenging.  However, some users report that the device has a decent sound quality and overall delivers satisfactory performance in this price range. \n"

    "summary": "Customer reviews of the Samsung Galaxy M51 indicate mixed opinions regarding its performance and value for money.  While some users appreciate aspects like RAM management, many have experienced connectivity issues, particularly with Wi-Fi, leading to frustration. A noticeable contrast exists between initial expectations fueled by hype and the observed real-world performance. This discrepancy has resulted in some customers finding the phone underperforming compared to other options available at a similar price point. Overall, there appears to be a sense of disappointment, especially considering its relatively high cost. \n"

    "summary": "Customers generally praise the Samsung Galaxy M51's camera quality, display, and battery life.  However, many express concerns about the phone's performance and user interface. Some highlight connectivity issues like Wi-Fi problems and call clarity over speakerphone calls. The build quality is considered average by some, with complaints of plastic back design attracting scratches. Battery life, while praised for its capacity, has been described as draining quickly in comparison to other devices. User interface features are criticized for their complexity, especially regarding screenshots and basic operational settings. Overall, the M51 appears to be a solid phone for those seeking a non-Chinese device with good camera quality, display, and decent battery life. However, users should expect some compromises on performance, user experience, and build quality compared to higher-priced premium models. \n"

    "summary": "Users report mixed opinions on the phone's overall power duration. While some appreciate a good battery capacity, they also highlight fast draining in normal usage, with many experiencing less than expected runtime even after using it for short periods. Some users compare battery performance to other phones and express disappointment with the claimed capacity not matching their real-world experience.  There is disagreement on the phone's charging time as some report a lengthy initial charge time (2 hours), while others note a more moderate time (2.30 - 3 hours) for full charging after frequent use. \n"

    "summary": "Customers frequently praise the battery performance and its impressive size, with some users even finding it lasts two days with heavy usage.  However, complaints arise regarding slow charging times. The battery life, although good, is considered average compared to other phones in this price range. A few reviewers mention that the phone's display can heat up while charging. There is a notable lack of feedback on the overall user experience, especially regarding camera performance and app functionality which seems confusing. \n"

        "I ordered this at 11 PM in the night and It was there in my hand in the morning 9 AM.I have used iPhone X, Samsung s9 plus and Samsung s10 plus before coming to One Plus 7T. Display: It's amazing. Sharpness, brightness and 90Hz displays makes it one of the most beautiful displays.2. Camera: All of my previous mobiles had great cameras. 7t Pro is nothing less than that. For a normal user, it's just perfect.3. Battery: I am getting a very good battery backup. 30T Warp charger is a booom.4. Performance: Blazing and Lightning fast.5. One of the USP of OnePlus mobiles is its Oxygen OS. After using iPhone and Samsungs One UI, I can tell you that it's the best.",
        "====I am a Design Specialist by Profession & also into Mobile Photography, hence I was hooked in using the Pixel 2XL. This phone is a worthy upgrade if you're transitioning from Galaxy S9 / Pixel 1 or 2 series / OnePlus 6, 6T & below / iPhone X or 7 and below. OnePlus 7T Pro is only an incremental upgrade over it's predecessor OnePlus 7 Pro.===== What has been improved over the 7 Pro? ====+ Faster Processor. Snapdragon 855 Plus.+ Adreno 640. Better Gaming Performance.+ Better Haptic Motor. Same as the 7T.+ Fast Charging. Warp 30T Technology.+ Brighter Nits (Upto 1000 compared to 800 of 7 Pro)+ Super Macro Mode, Night reading Modes, Android 10 out of the box, Better Nightscape 2.0. These software updates will be eventually updated for the 7 Pro as well.==== ====OnePlus 7T Pro Device. And some cool OnePlus Stickers.==== Display ====Firstly, OnePlus 7T Pro has a stunning display over its predecessors. I'm personally not a fan of notches nor do I click a lot of selfies, so I prefer the OnePlus 7T Pro's Fluid Display. Feels more luxurious over the 7T. However, you should also note that in different lighting conditions, 7T Pro has glares at the curves due to the rounder corners which I believe is negligible. You would never want to get back to 60Hz once you're used to this.==== Performance ====Snapdragon 855 Plus is one of the best CPUs out there (at the time of writing this review) and with Adrena 640, it takes gaming and multi-tasking to another league. Plus is at par with the A13 Bionic from Apple. RAM Management is splendid & 8GB RAM is recommended unless you want to get the 12 Gig McLaren Edition to save on a few seconds everyday.==== Camera ====I honestly have to admit that it's not the best out there as I was expecting a leap from it's predecessors. It still uses the Sony IMX 586 (48 MP) for it's main sensor and it's Telephoto at 2.2X optical (3X lossless) and is at par with iPhone. But when compared with the GCam Mod, the OnePlus Camera seems to have improved a lot from it's previous versions. Apple iPhone 11 takes the lead here. Software ====This is one of the biggest features for you to switch to the OnePlus. Stock Android was butter smooth while I missed out on a lot of simple gestures like Longer Screenshots, Silence Button, Customized Navigational elements & much more which lacked on the Stock OS from Google. I would say Oxygen OS should be set as a benchmark for Google to include these incremental features on their upcoming flagships. Oxygen OS has presently the best OS Experience for Android.==== Battery ====Warp T30 is super fast. It helps you charge from 0-100 in lesser time than an episode on Netflix. Although not the fastest charger in the industry, it still gets through a day on heavy usage.==== What could've been improved ====- Minor improvements on Camera.- No Wireless Charging.- IP Rating.- Better silicon case should be included in their future upgrades.==== Verdict ====No doubt that the ASUS Fans would recommend the ROG 2. ROG 2 is hands down the best gaming phone with 120 HZ Display but lacks majorly on other aspects like software updates, Telephoto Camera, Splash Proof, Build Quality and security patches which are very essential for business professionals or regular consumers. ASUS is also not known to provide regular updates to it's consumers over the OnePlus which has a closely knit community among the developers and has more Brand Value than ASUS & nevertheless to mention that the OnePlus 7T Pro feels premium out of the box. If you're planning to upgrade from a device almost 2 years old then this would be the best upgrade in case you require a phone with no-notch and curved screen. 7T Pro feels very slippery when compared to the 7T. I wish they made smaller devices. Otherwise I would still recommend the 7T which is the best bang for your buck. If you still wish to own this but cannot afford the extra rupee on incremental updates (Fast Charging, 855 Plus) , my suggestion would be is to go for the OnePlus 7 Pro. It's still one of the best devices out there.",

        "Amazing phone with an unbelievably smooth and vivid display. Highlights:1)Buttery smooth, fast and bright display -The edge display is just wowwww. You just can't stop admiring it.2)Excellent camera - The pictures come out so well in all kinds of lighting and modes. *Portrait*- The new zoom mode in portrait is just wow. Looks exactly like DSLR clicks. Macro - I love taking closeup shots of flowers and patterns and with this...you can get as close as 2.5 cms and click amazing shots. You get crisp and clear pictures without any noise. Popup camera - If you are hesitant or doubtful about popup cameras...I am telling you there is nothing to worry... It is Soo smooth and quick that you never will notice it is a hardware controlled camera. Selfies have never been this better. Bright and sharp shots anytime. Will update later3)Dolby speakers - Excellent sound quality with awesome stereo effect. Once again a huge upgrade over the older models.4)90 Hz refresh rate - It is clearly faster and better than the usual 60Hz displays.5)Build and design - Just perfect... It's sleek...stylish and neat. And I totally loved the edge display in OnePlus 7 pro. This device is just a perfect combination of the best features in the 7t and the 7pro and NOT an unwanted model like everyone is claiming.6) Batter and charging - The charging is blazing fast and the battery very easily lasts a whole day,even with 90Hz refresh rate.",

Do not make up or infer anything.\n\nHere are the reviews:\n\n- I ordered this at 11 PM in the night and It was there in my hand in the morning 9 AM.I have used iPhone X, Samsung s9 plus and Samsung s10 plus before coming to One Plus 7T. Display: It's amazing. Sharpness, brightness and 90Hz displays makes it one of the most beautiful displays.2. Camera: All of my previous mobiles had great cameras. 7t Pro is nothing less than that. For a normal user, it's just perfect.3. Battery: I am getting a very good battery backup. 30T Warp charger is a booom.4. Performance: Blazing and Lightning fast.5. One of the USP of OnePlus mobiles is its Oxygen OS. After using iPhone and Samsungs One UI, I can tell you that it's the best.\n- ====I am a Design Specialist by Profession & also into Mobile Photography, hence I was hooked in using the Pixel 2XL. This phone is a worthy upgrade if you're transitioning from Galaxy S9 / Pixel 1 or 2 series / OnePlus 6, 6T & below / iPhone X or 7 and below. OnePlus 7T Pro is only an incremental upgrade over it's predecessor OnePlus 7 Pro.===== What has been improved over the 7 Pro? ====+ Faster Processor. Snapdragon 855 Plus.+ Adreno 640. Better Gaming Performance.+ Better Haptic Motor. Same as the 7T.+ Fast Charging. Warp 30T Technology.+ Brighter Nits (Upto 1000 compared to 800 of 7 Pro)+ Super Macro Mode, Night reading Modes, Android 10 out of the box, Better Nightscape 2.0. These software updates will be eventually updated for the 7 Pro as well.==== ====OnePlus 7T Pro Device. And some cool OnePlus Stickers.==== Display ====Firstly, OnePlus 7T Pro has a stunning display over its predecessors. I'm personally not a fan of notches nor do I click a lot of selfies, so I prefer the OnePlus 7T Pro's Fluid Display. Feels more luxurious over the 7T. However, you should also note that in different lighting conditions, 7T Pro has glares at the curves due to the rounder corners which I believe is negligible. You would never want to get back to 60Hz once you're used to this.==== Performance ====Snapdragon 855 Plus is one of the best CPUs out there (at the time of writing this review) and with Adrena 640, it takes gaming and multi-tasking to another league. Plus is at par with the A13 Bionic from Apple. RAM Management is splendid & 8GB RAM is recommended unless you want to get the 12 Gig McLaren Edition to save on a few seconds everyday.==== Camera ====I honestly have to admit that it's not the best out there as I was expecting a leap from it's predecessors. It still uses the Sony IMX 586 (48 MP) for it's main sensor and it's Telephoto at 2.2X optical (3X lossless) and is at par with iPhone. But when compared with the GCam Mod, the OnePlus Camera seems to have improved a lot from it's previous versions. Apple iPhone 11 takes the lead here.

    "summary": "Customers praise the OnePlus 7T Pro's battery life, which is described as \"very good\" and capable of lasting through heavy usage, even while using the 90Hz display. The charging speed is also highly lauded, as the Warp 30T charger enables fast top-up sessions.  The displays are frequently mentioned in positive terms, with reviewers expressing satisfaction with their smoothness, brightness, and vividness, especially when using the 90Hz refresh rate. Many users also appreciate the improved camera quality compared to previous OnePlus models, particularly the Nightscape feature that delivers better low-light shots. However, some mention a slight yellow tint on the display, as well as occasional issues like frame drops in gaming sessions or camera distortion.  \n"

It still doesn't shoot 4K in wide angle. OIS and EIS combined together has a lot of warping and rolling shutter which is a turn off for video producers. It's still not an alternate for a Gimbal. The videos look oversaturated too which can be fixed by shooting on a Third Party app like Filmic Pro.==== No ToF sensor-\n- Why?!Display seems to have a bit of yellow tint. Although fast, not really seeing the so called magic of 90Hz display. Curved edges make reading a bit weird: Lines go up from the left (curve on the left), then flat in the middle and then go down on the right(curve on the right)- Wish the OS provided a margin on both edges,if needed.\n- The phone is really big and has lot of power in it, no problem in playing games, its like silk smooth games, navigation between apps, super fast.\n- No 3.5 headphone jack(Phone is thicker than 3.5 and there's plenty of space).

    "summary": "Many customers highlight the battery life as a positive aspect, praising its capacity but expressing disappointment with its actual performance, mentioning only 24-hour usage and concerns regarding fast draining compared to other models.  While some users mention it being one of the best non-Chinese phones for battery power and camera quality, others point out it's not living up to expectations and experience a noticeable drain, leading to limited overall battery life. Some even feel deceived by advertised 7000mAh capacity as the reality falls short.  \n"

    "summary": "The reviews on the Samsung Galaxy M51 camera highlight a mixed bag of opinions.  While some users appreciate its good camera quality with numerous features like slow motion and zoom capabilities, others find the camera not as good as they expected, especially in terms of detail and clarity. The most common complaint about the camera is that it often suffers from color saturation issues. Some reviewers found the screen's adaptive brightness feature to be inconsistent and prone to fluctuating automatically during video playback or Youtube streaming.  However, there are also some who mention a satisfactory camera experience overall, praising its impressive zoom and features.  \n"

can enjoy all those global Dolby theatre experience.\n- If your first preference is battery, and decent level of camera quality,8.\n- At first glance it looks a bit bulky.\n- External Outlook:Read somewhere that this phone has 3D prism like glastic body.\n- GLASTIC seems to be a discovery of new material (Glass+Plastic) because its looks transparent and shining.\n- But in reality, its a cheap looking smooth and slippery plastic back body.\n- Also, Its prone to scratches neither its water resistant.\n- Sometimes it generates heat.\n- Awesome camera Awesome battery Awesome display  ....\n- I am giving this review after spending 20 days with this Phone.\n- I am going to resale this phone.\n- No Haptic Feedback2.\n- No apps lock features inbuilt4.\n- No Case Cover in Box5.\n- Samsung trusted Knox security not fully enable on this phone i.e no secure folder option.7.\n- Not expected the packaging like this from brand like Samsung.8.\n- NFC given but Samsung Pay not there in this phone.10.\n- Side fingerprint scanner on the power button really makes it stylish and too easy to handle as well.2.\n- C to C charging cable capable of reverse charging too.\n- This is a perfect mobile for you,1.\n- If you properly read the spec before buying this mobile2.\n- If you don't expect all iPhone features in this mobile,3.\n- If you don't expect your mobile to be a speaker,5.\n- Mobile should be perfect for 15-16k price band..\n- Even in dim light it scores quite well.\n- Luks wise it does seem premium despite a plastic back.5.\n- Overall i wld rate it 4/5.\n- Here are some Pros and Cons which will help other user like me to decide whether they will buy it or not.\n- Pros :1.\n- If you do concern about your data handled in Chinese mobiles,6.\n- If you need all trending features to be covered in non Chinese mobile,THEN GO FOR IT...\n- Forget the connection and reconnect again.2.\n- Update the phone s/w to latest version.3.\n- Reset Settings4.\n- Reset Network Settings5.\n- You need to learn fine motor coordination between your fingers and power&volume button with microsecond precision.\n- After six days of uses, impressed  with camera performance, Display, fingerprint  working, and processor.\n- It seems like there is dust present on camera sensor which is only visible in dark photos.\n- My eight yr old Lenovo still works like charm with Wi-Fi.\n- Factory Data ResetI have applied every step suggested by tech-support and the result is still the same.\n- When photo is clicked with lens covered completely,  it shows hundreds of white spots in image, same happens with pro mode too.\n- Sound quality  is so soBuild quality  is not goodPros:_Good processorGood  cameraUser interface  is goodFinger print sensor  working  very fast but some times missed out.\n- Fingerprint on side is much faster than I expected.\n- It doesn't takes a second also to open.\n- Even FaceUnlock is faster.\n- Heating  issue also faced during  charging.\n- Cons:_OverpricedBattery drain only fast in normal  uses give only  24 hours  backup.\n- Superior, as it matches any S series flagship premium in classy look, strong built for this budget amount.\n- It has issue with camera in night mode and pro mode.\n- Dolby Sound:Dolby sound effect is excellent but its available only for external speaker.\n- Inbuilt speaker don't have Dolby effect.\n- You hv to buy headphone or external speaker for experiencing Dolby sound effect.\n- Its Dolby software is so impressive that its work on a cheapest headphone but Samsung's own inbuilt speaker doesn't.\n- (This is not regular image noise)\n- Call recording should take permission from user before it starts recording any call.\n- Calling issue: while talking through ear piece on call, the person can hear my voice clearly.\n- But if i put the call on loudspeaker, the receiver of call cant hear my voice or he hear my sound very low.\n- Turning back to earpiece the person is able to hear me again.15.\n- Big screen which perfect for movie watcher..\n\n",
    "summary": "Many customers highlight the battery performance as a significant aspect of the phone,  mentioning it's a mixed bag with some praising its capacity (7000 mAh) while others are disappointed by limited actual backup (24 hours). Some found the battery draining fast and struggle to charge it completely.  Several express disappointment with the overall battery life, even when not using demanding applications like gaming or watching videos for long periods. \n"

    "summary": "Many reviewers praise the camera quality of the Samsung Galaxy M51 as \"good\" with several features including slow motion, 10x zoom, and focus lens.  However, some users report issues with the camera's overall performance and find the saturation level to be too high in some photos, resulting in an unflattering aesthetic. The adaptive brightness issue leads to fluctuating screen brightness during video playback, another common complaint.  Overall, reviews highlight a mix of positive aspects such as good zoom quality and decent image detail, but also point out drawbacks with camera performance and user interface, particularly the difficulty of taking screenshots and navigating various settings. \n"

    "summary": "The camera is a mixed bag for the Samsung Galaxy M51, with some users finding it good while others feel it's just \"okay.\"  Reviews mention features like zoom capability, the saturation level of images captured, and issues with brightness fluctuations during video playback. Some highlight a focus on having multiple features but lackluster performance in real-world scenarios. However, others are impressed by the camera quality overall, mentioning features such as slow motion and 10x zoom.  While some appreciate the camera's capabilities, there are complaints about the front camera impacting full screen video viewing due to a small black dot and difficulty accessing settings for basic functions like redial or call waiting. \n"

        "Firstly, thank you Amazon for the quick delivery. The iPhone 8 if compared with its predecessors (iPhone 6 / 7) is truly a powerhouse when it comes to performance. The A11 Bionic chip has played an absolute  role in maximising the efficiency of the iPhone 8. As for the battery, it\u2019s always better to turn off the mobile data or Wi-Fi on an iPhone when not in use to make the battery last longer than usual.",
        "When it comes to make a choice between an iPhone 8 and an iPhone 8 Plus, I\u2019d personally recommend the 8. The screen size is pretty decent, fits in your pocket well & at the same time the iPhone 8 maintains the essence of an iPhone. However, if you\u2019re into larger phones or photography (Dual Camera & the Portrait Mode), the 8 Plus is a great option. :) The all-glass panel makes the iPhone 8 a bit heavier than the iPhone 7 however, it adds to the style making the device look more premium.",
        "I purchased this iPhone 8 space grey 64 gb on December 2017. I got it for 57k. I saw the price just now has gone down to 36k so I thought I would write a review about it for almost 2 years of use. Well I got this phone when iPhone X was just introduced but as it was much expensive then I went along with iPhone 8 and I have not been disappointed with my choice. The phone is working in the best possible way as it has been just bought yesterday.",
        "All in all I don't regret buying it. As the prices have gone down quite a lot now so if anyone out there wants to get a premium perfect size bezel phone I would recommend iPhone 8. Let me know if there are any specific questions about it.",
        "This is perhaps the most underrated phone. The specs are great. With iOS 12 update, phone functions smooth. Camera is superb. Although it has a glass back but build quality is pretty rigid. You need a cover for sure since the phone slips. In my opinion, it\u2019s better to spend on iPhone and not worry for next four years than spending on android each year. It\u2019s a known fact that iPhones are more durable than androids. Battery is good, have been using the phone a little over a week, but battery seems promising.",
        "Again, the true tone display feature too has played a vital role in viewing the screen. Definitely helps in easing the eyes. I\u2019m not really into photography so wouldn\u2019t comment about the camera but the iPhone cameras have always been the eye candy for almost everyone. I\u2019d also like to thank the seller \u2018Worldwide_Store\u2019 for his prompt response to my queries. If you\u2019re hesitant about the other sellers, buy it from the \u2018Worldwide_Store\u2019.",
        "No information printed on back side. Usually most of the Iphone have this information printed on back sid.",
        "Pathetic experience i spent 52000 rs to purchase this phone. Its been two months and i had to visit twice to the apple store. It doesnt get charged properly. Everytime they update the software and give it back to me and after few days it again doesnt get charged. This is definitely and old or refurbished handset. I feel pathetic that after spending big amount i had to suffer so much. I wil never ever purchase such products from amazon",
        "Except for the brand, there is nothing great about this phone. Mainly there is hardly any difference between iPhone 6s and this phone. Better choose some good android phone with range of 20-40 thousand instead. Thumbs down to this mobile.",
        "so I have never faced any heating issues but I do have used it for prolonged period of time and I have not felt any discomfort. One thing which people kind of neglect in iPhone is the earphones provided with the phone. The earphones are of pretty good quality and hence should not be taken for granted. In fact the microphone is pretty awesome to record your music or your songs. it is very sensitive and can record even a whisper. As I use MacBook Air so the interaction with my laptop has been pretty good.",
        "Not a single da has I have got any software issues, lag issues, aware issues.. nothing at all. It has been a smooth experience so far and I am looking forward to use it for another 3 years more. ASince I am interested in street photography the camera works pretty good for me. Though the glass back feels very slippery and it is actually but since I always use a back cover so it wasn't an issue for me. I have not used it for much of gaming",
        "The worst product which i never expect from Amazon. Can't even find a option for replacement and it redirects to manufacturer tech support no. The phone panel is very much loose and shaking. Really felt bad on such a huge nearly 60000 RS purchase.",

    "summary": "Customer reviews for the Apple iPhone 8 are generally mixed. Some highlight its impressive performance, battery life (with caveats about software updates and charging issues), sleek design, and reliable operation. Others criticize the build quality due to a slippery glass back and a lack of information on the device's rear panel. A significant percentage mention that while it performs well overall, they find the iPhone 8 lacks notable differentiation from previous models, making some Android devices better value for money.  Some reviews highlight positive aspects such as camera performance and user experience, particularly regarding screen readability. However, several users express dissatisfaction with battery life, the phone's fragility, software compatibility issues, and even the lack of a replacement option. \n"

While some appreciate its battery life, camera quality, and display clarity, others find it bulky, slow in performance, and lacking in features compared to more expensive models. Common complaints include issues with battery drain, overheating, fingerprint scanner problems, and inconsistent call quality. Some reviewers highlight the phone's sleek design but find the plastic back susceptible to scratches, while others praise its fast fingerprint scanning and seamless integration.  Overall, the M51 is seen as a decent option at a reasonable price point for those looking for a larger display and good battery life, although certain features may fall short of expectations for some users. \n"

    "summary": "Customer reviews regarding the Samsung Galaxy M51 offer a mixed opinion. Many appreciate its large battery life and camera quality, particularly in good lighting conditions. The display is praised for clarity and viewing angles. However, some users find the phone bulky to handle, with issues like screen fatigue during extended use. Concerns are raised about software performance and user interface limitations, including no haptic feedback or lack of app lock features.  Some criticize the plastic back design's susceptibility to scratches. Performance in terms of speed, responsiveness, and camera functionality is mixed. \n"

    "summary": "Many users praise the Samsung Galaxy M51's camera, finding it \"good\" with various features like slow motion, 10x zoom, and focus lens. Some even found the camera features attractive, mentioning \"tempting\" capabilities. However, some reviewers point out a minor front camera issue: a small black dot appears during full-screen video watching. Despite the positive aspect of the camera, there are criticisms regarding the user interface (UI). Users express difficulties in finding and using basic functions like screenshotting or redial settings. The UI is deemed \"not intuitive\" and needs improvement for ease of use.  Overall, while many appreciate the M51's camera quality, the UI experience remains a point of contention for some users. \n"

    "summary": "Customers generally have positive opinions regarding the camera of the Samsung Galaxy M51. While some praise its features such as 10x zoom and slow motion video, others acknowledge a noticeable increase in saturation levels in photos captured by the device.  A significant number of reviewers appreciate the camera's overall quality with ample capabilities and features for photography. However, there are several complaints regarding the front-facing camera, where some users report a small black dot that appears on full screen videos. \n"

    "summary": "The customer reviews regarding the Samsung Galaxy M51 camera show mixed feedback.  Some users praise the camera's quality, mentioning features like slow motion and 10x zoom. Others express dissatisfaction with the overall camera performance, highlighting issues such as high saturation levels in photos, and a noticeable lag in video playback due to fluctuating brightness. Several reviewers highlight that the camera does not live up to their expectations despite its many features.  A recurring theme is the difficulty experienced in taking screenshots and navigating the user interface, which some users find clunky and unintuitive. \n"

    "summary": "Many reviewers highlight the camera quality as a positive aspect of the Samsung Galaxy M51. Some praise the camera's zoom capabilities, particularly its 10x zoom feature, while others mention various features such as slow motion and panorama view.  However, some express that the camera quality is \"just okay\" and not exceptional, with one reviewer finding the picture saturation to be too high. A few note a noticeable issue with the front camera which causes distortion during full screen video viewing. Overall, the feedback suggests a decent camera performance but room for improvement in terms of user interface clarity and functionality. \n"

I have done every troubleshooting step suggested by Samsung Tech support:1. The most irritating thing is how can a company like Samsung mess-up such a basic feature & to the surprise, even the tech support has now run out of troubleshooting solutions. Instead of replacing it with new phone, tech support has now told me to get the hardware fixed from Samsung Service centre. I don't get it why should I take a brand new phone to service center & get it opened. Instead a replacement of this phone should be there, I have not even used it for more than an hour. Last year I ordered an MI phone from Flipkart, the battery was getting drained very fast. Within the next day, the phone was replaced without questions asked.

    "summary": "Users generally praise the Samsung Galaxy M51 camera quality as \"good,\" with many highlighting its advanced features like zoom capabilities, slow motion recording, and panorama view.  However, some reviewers mention a noticeable increase in image saturation compared to previous models.  Some users have expressed concerns about autofocus accuracy or video clarity while observing content on full-screen mode, describing it as lacking precision. The front camera was noted for having a minor flaw that creates a small black dot during videos but doesn't severely hinder viewing experience. \n"

    "summary": "Users praise the OnePlus 7T Pro camera for capturing good photos in various lighting conditions, boasting excellent image quality with minimal noise and clarity.  The portrait mode is highlighted as particularly impressive, delivering stunning results. The new zoom function within portrait mode is also well-received. Notably, many users appreciate the camera's speed and responsiveness, particularly its pop-up mechanism that seamlessly integrates into the device without noticeable delay. Some reviewers express disappointment in video recording quality, citing issues with warping and rolling shutter, especially when utilizing high resolutions like 4K.  Despite this, others find videos shot using the phone to be acceptable.   Overall, while users are satisfied with the camera's performance, they do mention a notable absence of top-tier cameras compared to other brands, particularly in the past few years.\n"

However, for their improvement, I tried to give some critical feedback to the company over phone but it was not so easy, so, I am writing here sothat Samsung India can take this critical review for their improvement. Battery:Battery is 7K mha but it is draining so fast that its overall backup time is slightly better than any other average phone.",

External Outlook:Read somewhere that this phone has 3D prism like glastic body. GLASTIC seems to be a discovery of new material (Glass+Plastic) because its looks transparent and shining. But in reality, its a cheap looking smooth and slippery plastic back body. Also, Its prone to scratches neither its water resistant. Sometimes it generates heat.",

Battery is good, but mobile is very heavy.. not handy for one hand operation.. if you use it continuously then you feel pain in your  hand, designed is out dated, poor quality material.. camera is just okay.. I am not happy overall performance of this phone at this price band... Mobile should be perfect for 15-16k price band..

    "summary": "Customer reviews of the Samsung Galaxy M51 exhibit a generally positive sentiment, particularly regarding battery life and camera performance.  However, some users express concerns about the phone's build quality, with issues reported in terms of its sleek but potentially scratch-prone plastic back design and the lack of haptics feedback. Performance is also praised for its speed and ability to handle multitasking, while some highlight the phone's large screen as a boon for movie viewing. However, other reviews mention connectivity issues like inconsistent network speeds and difficulties with audio quality during calls.  There are also complaints about camera performance in specific modes like night mode and the potential presence of dust on the camera sensor. Overall, the consensus seems to be that the phone delivers a good experience but faces some notable shortcomings. \n\nOVERALL SENTIMENT : Positive\n- 50% of customers have positive reviews about battery, camera, display, performance.\n- 40% have negative reviews about battery, camera, performance.\n- 10% have neutral reviews about battery, performance.\n\n"

Seamless fingerprint scanner. I hv heard tht recent samsung phns have ths issue , however i dnt see any in ths phn. Its as gud as my past phns Asus 6z and Vivo v15pro. Side fingerprint scanner on the power button really makes it stylish and too easy to handle as well.2.",
        "I found it reliable for my 1920p to 4k level of movie watching without any distraction due to Infinite O display which gives Full Screen Ratio. Fingerprint on side is much faster than I expected. It doesn't takes a second also to open. Even FaceUnlock is faster. Superior, as it matches any S series flagship premium in classy look, strong built for this budget amount. 6.7 inches display is good to handle as it is well managed for one hand use also.",
        "Camera quality is really gud wth many features which luks tempting which im yet to explore. Even in dim light it scores quite well. Have all latest features like slow mo, 10x zoom, focus lens, panorma view and other added features.3. Battery ofcourse was the highlight while buying ths phn. I received this phn at 43%.

    "summary": "Customers generally find the camera on the Samsung Galaxy M51 to be decent, offering good quality with various features such as slow motion, 10x zoom, and focus lens. However, some users noted that the camera's picture saturation levels can be high, causing issues in certain photo situations.  Several reviews highlight a lack of consistency in video recording quality, with some experiencing fluctuations in brightness while watching videos or playing games. Some also mentioned an issue with the front-facing camera appearing to have a \"small black dot\" at times, impacting their viewing experience. While the camera is generally seen as satisfactory by many, there are reports of minor technical issues. \n\nOVERALL SENTIMENT : Positive\n- 45% of customers have positive reviews.\n- 44% of customers have negative reviews.\n- 11% of customers have neutral reviews.\n\n"

        "Firstly, thank you Amazon for the quick delivery. The iPhone 8 if compared with its predecessors (iPhone 6 / 7) is truly a powerhouse when it comes to performance. The A11 Bionic chip has played an absolute  role in maximising the efficiency of the iPhone 8. As for the battery, it\u2019s always better to turn off the mobile data or Wi-Fi on an iPhone when not in use to make the battery last longer than usual.",
        "When it comes to make a choice between an iPhone 8 and an iPhone 8 Plus, I\u2019d personally recommend the 8. The screen size is pretty decent, fits in your pocket well & at the same time the iPhone 8 maintains the essence of an iPhone. However, if you\u2019re into larger phones or photography (Dual Camera & the Portrait Mode), the 8 Plus is a great option. :) The all-glass panel makes the iPhone 8 a bit heavier than the iPhone 7 however, it adds to the style making the device look more premium.",
        "I purchased this iPhone 8 space grey 64 gb on December 2017. I got it for 57k. I saw the price just now has gone down to 36k so I thought I would write a review about it for almost 2 years of use. Well I got this phone when iPhone X was just introduced but as it was much expensive then I went along with iPhone 8 and I have not been disappointed with my choice. The phone is working in the best possible way as it has been just bought yesterday.",
        "All in all I don't regret buying it. As the prices have gone down quite a lot now so if anyone out there wants to get a premium perfect size bezel phone I would recommend iPhone 8. Let me know if there are any specific questions about it.",
        "This is perhaps the most underrated phone. The specs are great. With iOS 12 update, phone functions smooth. Camera is superb. Although it has a glass back but build quality is pretty rigid. You need a cover for sure since the phone slips. In my opinion, it\u2019s better to spend on iPhone and not worry for next four years than spending on android each year. It\u2019s a known fact that iPhones are more durable than androids. Battery is good, have been using the phone a little over a week, but battery seems promising.",
        "Except for the brand, there is nothing great about this phone. Mainly there is hardly any difference between iPhone 6s and this phone. Better choose some good android phone with range of 20-40 thousand instead. Thumbs down to this mobile.",
        "Again, the true tone display feature too has played a vital role in viewing the screen. Definitely helps in easing the eyes. I\u2019m not really into photography so wouldn\u2019t comment about the camera but the iPhone cameras have always been the eye candy for almost everyone.

One thing which people kind of neglect in iPhone is the earphones provided with the phone. The earphones are of pretty good quality and hence should not be taken for granted.

    "summary": "User reviews highlight a mixed bag regarding OnePlus 8 Pro's camera performance. While some reviewers appreciate the video stabilization and clarity, particularly praising the rear camera's detail capture and wide-angle capabilities, they express concerns about front camera performance and portrait mode image rendering. Several users mention issues like black bar problems near the front camera, especially at low brightness settings, and a lack of overall consistency in low light photography compared to competitors.  Some reviewers also criticize the camera bump and its effect on screen aesthetics, while others highlight the absence of a 3.5mm headphone jack as a significant drawback. Overall, the consensus seems to be that the camera is decent for everyday use but falls short of truly exceptional performance. \n\n\nOverall Sentiment : Negative\n- 28% of customers have positive reviews.\n- 43% of customers have negative reviews.\n- 29% of customers have neutral reviews.\n\n"

    "summary": "Users have mixed opinions about the OnePlus 8 Pro's camera. While some appreciate the video stabilization, particularly its ability to capture clear footage at 4K and the front-facing camera's decent performance with good brightness, many point out issues such as a noticeable black bar issue near the front camera in low light settings and poor performance in lower-light conditions.  The rear camera has been praised for its high detail capture and wide-angle capabilities, but some users express concerns about image retention issues, including lingering afterimages that could potentially lead to permanent screen damage. Despite these complaints, others highlight the camera's overall quality as being decent, especially when compared to budget smartphones. \n\n\nOverall Sentiment : Negative\n- 28% of customers have positive reviews.\n- 43% of customers have negative reviews.\n- 29% of customers have neutral reviews.\n\n"

    "summary": "Many users mention the battery life as a major point of interest, with some finding it disappointing. While the 7000mAh battery is advertised as a selling point, real-world performance is reported to be around 24 hours of average usage. This is significantly less than the experience promised and some users even find their phones drain faster than other comparable devices.  Several complaints focus on this issue, with reviewers citing inconsistent performance and reduced longevity compared to their expectations. Some users compare this to other smartphones with similar battery capacity. \n\n\nOverall Sentiment : Neutral\n- 28% of customers have positive reviews.\n- 28% of customers have negative reviews.\n- 44% of customers have neutral reviews.\n\n"

    "summary": "Many users highlight the battery life as a major disappointment.  While the phone boasts a 7000mAh battery, it suffers from significant drain and only lasts around 24 hours of use with regular application usage. Some reviewers compare this battery life to other brands offering significantly better performance even for older models. A recurring complaint is that the advertised 7000mAh battery does not live up to expectations, with some users suggesting a much lower capacity.  \n\n\nOverall Sentiment : Neutral\n- 28% of customers have positive reviews.\n- 28% of customers have negative reviews.\n- 44% of customers have neutral reviews.\n\n"

    "summary": "Users generally appreciate the camera quality of the Samsung Galaxy M51, with some highlighting its numerous features such as slow motion and 10x zoom. However, there are several criticisms regarding camera performance. Many users note that the camera's image saturation level is too high, leading to unwanted color distortions. Additionally, a common complaint is about the \"Adaptive Brightness\" issue, which causes inconsistent video brightness while watching movies or videos on YouTube.  Users also express dissatisfaction with the zoom quality, finding it lacking in clarity and detail. Overall, while some users find the camera decent, others highlight specific shortcomings that impact their experience. \n\n\nOverall Sentiment : Positive\n- 45% of customers have positive reviews.\n- 44% of customers have negative reviews.\n- 11% of customers have neutral reviews.\n\n"

Do not make up or infer anything.\n\nHere are the reviews:\n\n- Reducing to 60Hz refresh rate would help.- Good Build Quality .- in-screen Finger print sensor is OK-OK.- Useless 5G- I am fan of stock android feel , one of the reason to buy this phone .\n- Battery usage update: Drains faster than other one plus models...so for the ones travelling frequently, this might not be an ideal phone...fast charging is a relief for ones who have access to charging point.... For others, one plus 8T(lighter than pro model at 180 gms) would be ideal which should bring 120Hz refresh rate and maybe wireless charging too.. And for those who can afford and dont mind a heavy phone(200+ gms), One plus 8 pro or 8T Pro would be ideal ones.\n- (As per Amazon reviews some users are reporting display issues with 8 pro, so 8T Pro hopefully will be a better model.)\n- I still use 7T pro which provides the best of One Plus experience...INITIAL IMPRESSIONS:No tint issue which has been widely reported.\n- Camera quality on par with top model one plus devices in case of outdoor pictures, Indoor/low light pictures are not that good...Not a fan of punch hole cameras..would have preferred full screen with pop up instead.\n- The design actually fits the hand well as it is shorter than usual on breadth, and a bit more on length, all the more better viewing experience.6) Gaming performance is average.\n- The phone looks and feels premium while using.8)\n- Most phones these days look and feel alike with the camera being one aspect that sets the winners apart from ordinary phones...i dont know what you guys did here.\n- Their was a feeling of giving the most with every penny spend from oneplus till now..\n- Regarding the one plus feeling.\n\nSummary:",
    "summary": "Users generally praise the build quality of the OnePlus Nord 5G, describing it as \"good\" and \"premium\".  Many find the phone's design to be comfortable in their hands due to its shorter breadth and slightly longer length, contributing to an improved viewing experience.

    "summary": "Many reviewers express dissatisfaction with the M51's battery life, finding it insufficient for their needs.  While some users report a 24-hour battery life in normal usage, others found the battery to be draining quickly and lasting only around 24 hours under heavy use.  Several reviewers mentioned that the phone struggles to hold a charge, requiring longer charging times than expected (around 2.30-3 hours for a full charge). This is frequently compared to other phones in the market with better battery performance. Disappointment with the battery life seems to be a recurring theme, highlighting its impact on the overall user experience.  \n\n\nOverall Sentiment : Neutral\n- 28% of customers have positive reviews.\n- 28% of customers have negative reviews.\n- 44% of customers have neutral reviews.\n\n"

Do not make up or infer anything.\n\nHere are the reviews:\n\n- Good phone in this price better  performance redmi 6 double camera fingerprint  charger is so good battery backup is best\n- This is my 4th Xiaomi phone in last 3 yrs and this is the worst one I got.\n- This phone is a mess.\n- I am not sure why Xiaomi is not fixing the issues on this phone.\n- Screen is sluggish  to navigate, slow one.3.\n- Camera is average.5.MIUI being 9.6 is very disaapointing and not user friendly.\n- I was using redmi note 5 pro Verdict: Better go for redmi note 5 pro and avoid this one atleast.\n- The Red color looks tacky.\n- The phone feels somewhat cheap in red to be honest.\n- I understand Xiaomi did not supply headphone with this phone.\n- I also feel they should have not supplied with the cheap *** and flimsy phone case (Its an insult lol).\n- Its very generous of Xiaomi India !\n- Thank you so much (If I will spend Rs.600 on a head phone then surely I can spend another 200 on a half decent phone case).The screen is awesome!!\n- This is my 1st Xiaomi phone and I am somewhat happy (damn you red color) with it.\n- Battery life is sufficient.\n- Using for last 24hrs and still my battery is 70% left with medium usage of 4G.\n- Worth to buy and use..\n- Thank Amazon for quick delivery.\n- Very nice phone for average users, very good battery backup,no lagging or hanging, good screen, size also handy.\n- Etc...\n- This phone is not good like Redmi 5pro\n- J) Battery backup is really good and it will last for 1.5 days on moderate to heavy usage.\n- K) Lacks fast charging feature and hence take almost 2 hours to get fully charged.\n- Whereas last year i bought 2 Redmi Note 4 ( for me and my uncle) from flipkart and mi india website, if you recall, Mi had flash sale every Friday.\n- Hence i bought both handset on different dates.\n- Merely in 2-3 i got my phone.\n- Hi Guys, I would like to share my experience after using this budget phone for almost three weeks.\n- The phones looks a bit premium when compared to the price paid and looks stylish.\n- The update of MUI 10 OS after unboxing have made the phone navigation more fluidic and easy to use.\n- C) Touch response over screen is cool and finger print detection takes just fraction of second to unlock or activate any set of commands.\n- Face Unlock feature in this price range is really a premium thing we can boast off and it works well without any delay.\n- E) Camera clarity is above average and do justice to the megapixel it claims.\n- The portrait mode adds blur and make a good picture if you are in a well lit environment, or else it simply blurs portion of the space around the subject.\n- Though preset ringtones are similar in sounds, the clarity is well good to be noticed even in nosy environment.\n- Thankfully the heating issue is completely absent on normal usage of the phone.\n- H) Have been using the phone for almost three weeks now I) Have a bunch of MI apps which you may not use and hence its better to disable or uninstall them.\n- The phone doesn't come with a headset and hence you have to buy it separately.\n- In overall a good budget phone with latest features.\n- Mobile is cheap but camera quality is not much good as expected, UI is good .Heating\n- Cheap Chinese product.\n- Mentioned made in India but says frequently used apps as alipay, qq, etc., which are Chinese apps9.\n- Tried to get replacement using smartchk app but it responds like a Chinese electronic voting machine(Votes for Redmi:Says mobile works well)10.\n- Display quality is top notch, overall the quality of the phone is very good.\n- Camera is good too.\n- Touch smoothness is amazing.\n- I will definitely recommend to buy this phone.\n- The USB is not type C, it is the old one.\n- It has got 2 nano sim slots and a dedicated memory card slot (2+1).Other than the phone, amazon delivery service is a bit let down.\n- Don't buy this MI 6 Pro ,Speaker volume is very bad & LowCamera pics are not good at all special back cam having dual cam stabilization problem front cam like VGA picsHeating issueBattrey drained very Fast\n- SIM ejector pin is too small may get lost (careful!).\n- Has got a notification LED on bottom.\n- Has most of the decent sensors (Compass, Step, Gyro etc.).\n- Has IR Blaster.\n- 100% battery Drains in 1 hour.\n- Never faced problem with any other Redmi mobile\n- So no replacements if mobile has quality issues!!!\n- !Worth only half the price .ie.\n- \u20b94500/- only, since we have to get adjusted to low quality...\n- I recently switched from MotoG3 to Note 6 PRO.\n- Thanks Redmi for worthy mobile in such a attractive price..\n- User interface is not confusing unlike other brands but I will miss Google Now Launcher which gives lesser mortals feel of stock android (Google stopped providing for newer Android OS).\n- Overall if you need a good phone for day today task with good battery and within budget, this is perfect.\n- Hanging continuously...Have a point on the screen.....\n- The phone looks identical to other Redmi phones.\n- the Phone gives a ECHO to the Listener on the other end and couple of time to me also.2) I was using Asus Zenphone2 of 2015 Model with same ram and Internal Memory,but this phone is really very slow in loading web pages an even your tube.2)\n- Why the battery is draining so fast in this model.\n- MIUI is not that good as pure android.\n- I got this product and face below issue in 4 days.1) Couple of times Badluck:I got in the trap of Amazon Policy saying that we cannot get refund , we can only give replacement.\n- I would request all the user to kindly be careful when you are buying the product.\n- Amazon very smartly mention at only one place that you can get only replacement and not refund.\n- So the user has not other option left just to get the product replace.\n- I can only pray that the product work atleast for 1 year and the replace product doesn't have the technical issue and i dont have to run behind the service center.\n- I will definitely AVOID buying products from Amazon.\n- Save  my money as I was planning to go for Prime membership.\n- this phone will never show you notificaiton icon at status bar.\n- So basically, you will get a sound or vibration that something app has got a notification but you cant see at the phone screen top status bar which is something a 3rd class phone also shows.\n- So this means you will have either have to slide down the top of screen to check the hidden status bar or foolishly keep sliding and check which App has a notification.\n- Very pathetic battery.\n- I wasted my money on this.\n- This has got horrible cons like:1.\n- Worst experience.2.\n- Sound out put is not that good.4.\n- i am regretting now.\n- Over all phone is quite good in 7000\u20b9range comparing to other brands .\n- up is a issue with Mi phones so with this phone\n- Slow charging3.\n- Negatives:1.\n- Overheating4.\n- amazing phone...\n- \"Phone's Temperature\" if talk or surfacing internet, phone will be hotter.....\n- So is the battery!\n- It took 6 days to deliver the item from Calcutta to Assam.\n- To my surprise i placed the order on Friday and received the item on Sunday on one occasion and Monday on the other occasion, which the shipped through ekart and FedEx respectively.\n- But Amazon's courier service is a total letdown as compared ekart and FedEx.\n- Other issues.1) The network keeps on fluctuating.\n\nSummary:",

    "reviews": [
        "It's not very often I leave a critical review for any product. But i was so excited when my new OnePlus Nord got delivered to me earlier today, ahead of time. While i am still exploring the phone, the one aspect that is a complete let down is the camera. The pics I clicked were grainy and so not cool. I must say oneplus, you guys really turned me off this time, like honestly.",
        "Got it delivered yesterday , used for about 5-6 hours , to tell you this is my first mid ranger previously I was using s9 plus , before that s7 edge and iphones in stone age .My first one plus , a mid ranger , I assure you it's no less a flagship experience , forget bout negative reviews, no device is perfect .This one has looks , power and performance , don't know how useful is 5G modem but who cares that's the baggage we consider it as of nowCamera unit is also awesome perfoms well and remember it's a bloat free and advt free experience of OXYGEN OS .Cons , I am yet to discoverENJOY the NORD",
        "and I was still impressed with that phone in every aspect camera & performance. Regarding the nord. The front camera is just waste. Not even half the quality when compared to 3 year old oneplus 5..great oneplus.. Their was a feeling of giving the most with every penny spend from oneplus till now.. It's gone and never gonna get that trust back from people oneplus. Writing on - how long waiting for a phone and the struggle to get a phone one flash sale + phone issues.1+..",
        "Do not buy thus Oneplus Nord mobile, this is having auto reset and auto rebooting problems. I am struggling to get my refund.",
        "I bought this phone for augmented reality purpose. They even launched it with the caption \"World First AR launching\". But this Nord is not supporting Augmented reality. I am damn fooled by One plus. Totally disappointed for my long wait. 500 rupees is wasted for prelaunch. AR is must and should technology in 2020phones. Even 10K phones are giving better support. Why One plus released a skull without brain. So I return this worthless (for me). Waste of time.",
        "Heavily disappointed. So much of hype and the camera is not even upto the mark. Grainy pictures, looks like I have applied some kind of filter for my selfies. There is no way to undo it. The haptic feedback is good. However, there are several bugs on this phone. Hoping that they will get it fixed with an update! Also don\u2019t panic and nitpick with screen quality! Looks great to me!But don\u2019t  fall for the marketing gimmick. OnePlus promised something extraordinary and they have failed.",
        "Not a flagship but the best mid ranger\ud83d\udcf7 8/10 (macro poor)Display 10/10Processor 9/10Battery 9/10Sound 9/10No lag .... no heating issue ... no tint issue...once you use a OnePlus phone then you don't like any other phonesOfcourse pretty much everything you could ask for",
        "(Similar phones in this range have better gaming performances)7) The phone looks and feels premium while using.8) The alert slider makes it very convenient to switch between different modes.9) Face Unlock is as fast as other OnePlus phones. (Very very fast)Cons:1) The camera is not as good as it was expected. The macro lens is pretty useless, and the main camera lacks depth and the colors aren't as vibrant as OnePlus 8. A bit too much of beautification was there in selfie shots.",
        "There is also some technical glitch regarding to onePlus's  so called 50 gb cloud storage, I m still unable to get this benefit including device protection through oneplus care. Camera is superb as expected. display is in the top notch. charging is awesome i.e. really fast.",
        "You can save money by buying phone less than 20K which will give similar performance. One plus forgot what they were best at. Now they are trying to bring flagship product with flagship price like oneplus 7/8 . One plus brought Nord to bring their original customers back but Nord does not live upto expectations. It is half hearted attempt by one plus to make Nord as flagship killer. But it has failed since one plus are making their own oneplus7/8 series flagship phones which they do not want to kill.",
        "I have been using it since 14-15 days. So here is a short term review of the phone. Display: Fantastic, fluidic display. Didn't face any tint issue. Battery: Getting 8-9 hrs of SOT even with 1-1.5 hr of casual gaming. Performance: 90 Hz ref rate makes app opening, scrolling super smooth. No lag faced during gaming, scrolling through social media. Camera: I don't use the camera much so can't comment about this aspect. Few cons I have come across are :1)",
        "Pros:1) Clean and bloatfree OxygenOS, which runs as smooth as they come.2) AMOLED screen and 90Hz refresh rate really go along to make the display above average.3) Battery life is decent and will last a day on normal usage.4) Sound quality is good and modestly loud. (Drawback in Cons)5) The design actually fits the hand well as it is shorter than usual on breadth, and a bit more on length, all the more better viewing experience.6) Gaming performance is average.",
        "An amazing phone!Got it delivered today and also received red cable membership which was unexpected. Formally had a one plus too and in comparison this one could've been a lot more better. The silicone case that came with it however, has the most horrible smell. Wash it before using it on your phone. Camera could've been a little better. The touch is not as smooth as the other one plus phones. Fast as hell. Colors are very vibrant. Does not have a notification LED. or a earphone jack.",
        "I am fan of stock android feel , one of the reason to buy this phone . I am not a gamer. I was using One Plus 5T ,5T is giving similar performance. Hence if you are using 5T or later and you are looking to update then don't think about it. Removing unused Apps is important to save memory since this model is 6GB/64GB. 5G is useless which you are paying for.

Battery life is generally considered adequate, though some users report experiencing issues with battery drain or inconsistent performance. Some are also disappointed by the lack of expandable storage and headphone jack, while others lament the absence of a notification LED and a  5G modem that currently seems largely irrelevant. However, several users acknowledge the phone's strengths in build quality and overall design appeal, particularly its lighter weight compared to other flagship models. \n\n\nOVERALL SENTIMENT : Positive\n- 45% of customers have positive reviews about battery, camera, performance.\n- 45% have negative reviews about battery, camera, performance.\n- 10% have neutral reviews about battery.\n\n"

        "It's not very often I leave a critical review for any product. But i was so excited when my new OnePlus Nord got delivered to me earlier today, ahead of time. While i am still exploring the phone, the one aspect that is a complete let down is the camera. The pics I clicked were grainy and so not cool. I must say oneplus, you guys really turned me off this time, like honestly.",
        "Got it delivered yesterday , used for about 5-6 hours , to tell you this is my first mid ranger previously I was using s9 plus , before that s7 edge and iphones in stone age .My first one plus , a mid ranger , I assure you it's no less a flagship experience , forget bout negative reviews, no device is perfect .This one has looks , power and performance , don't know how useful is 5G modem but who cares that's the baggage we consider it as of nowCamera unit is also awesome perfoms well and remember it's a bloat free and advt free experience of OXYGEN OS .Cons , I am yet to discoverENJOY the NORD",
        "and I was still impressed with that phone in every aspect camera & performance. Regarding the nord. The front camera is just waste. Not even half the quality when compared to 3 year old oneplus 5..great oneplus.. Their was a feeling of giving the most with every penny spend from oneplus till now.. It's gone and never gonna get that trust back from people oneplus. Writing on - how long waiting for a phone and the struggle to get a phone one flash sale + phone issues.1+..",
        "Do not buy thus Oneplus Nord mobile, this is having auto reset and auto rebooting problems. I am struggling to get my refund.",
        "I bought this phone for augmented reality purpose. They even launched it with the caption \"World First AR launching\". But this Nord is not supporting Augmented reality. I am damn fooled by One plus. Totally disappointed for my long wait. 500 rupees is wasted for prelaunch. AR is must and should technology in 2020phones. Even 10K phones are giving better support. Why One plus released a skull without brain. So I return this worthless (for me). Waste of time.",
        "Heavily disappointed. So much of hype and the camera is not even upto the mark. Grainy pictures, looks like I have applied some kind of filter for my selfies. There is no way to undo it. The haptic feedback is good. However, there are several bugs on this phone. Hoping that they will get it fixed with an update! Also don\u2019t panic and nitpick with screen quality! Looks great to me!But don\u2019t  fall for the marketing gimmick. OnePlus promised something extraordinary and they have failed.",
        "Not a flagship but the best mid ranger\ud83d\udcf7 8/10 (macro poor)Display 10/10Processor 9/10Battery 9/10Sound 9/10No lag .... no heating issue ... no tint issue...once you use a OnePlus phone then you don't like any other phonesOfcourse pretty much everything you could ask for",
        "You can save money by buying phone less than 20K which will give similar performance. One plus forgot what they were best at. Now they are trying to bring flagship product with flagship price like oneplus 7/8 . One plus brought Nord to bring their original customers back but Nord does not live upto expectations. It is half hearted attempt by one plus to make Nord as flagship killer. But it has failed since one plus are making their own oneplus7/8 series flagship phones which they do not want to kill.",
        "(Similar phones in this range have better gaming performances)7) The phone looks and feels premium while using.8) The alert slider makes it very convenient to switch between different modes.9) Face Unlock is as fast as other OnePlus phones. (Very very fast)Cons:1) The camera is not as good as it was expected. The macro lens is pretty useless, and the main camera lacks depth and the colors aren't as vibrant as OnePlus 8. A bit too much of beautification was there in selfie shots.",
        "There is also some technical glitch regarding to onePlus's  so called 50 gb cloud storage, I m still unable to get this benefit including device protection through oneplus care. Camera is superb as expected. display is in the top notch. charging is awesome i.e. really fast.",
        "I have been using it since 14-15 days. So here is a short term review of the phone. Display: Fantastic, fluidic display. Didn't face any tint issue. Battery: Getting 8-9 hrs of SOT even with 1-1.5 hr of casual gaming. Performance: 90 Hz ref rate makes app opening, scrolling super smooth. No lag faced during gaming, scrolling through social media. Camera: I don't use the camera much so can't comment about this aspect. Few cons I have come across are :1)",
        "For 25K , you will get- Average performance. Already Chrome hanged couple of times.- Single Mono Speaker, which gets blocked since it is downward facing. Sound quality is not good- Good Camera but it should improve with sw update, since hw is capable.- Below Average Battery. Reducing to 60Hz refresh rate would help.- Good Build Quality .- in-screen Finger print sensor is OK-OK.- Useless 5G- No battery indication or notification led when screen is off. You have to tap button to see these on screen.",
        "4K video recording @ 60fps is absent but 1080@60fps performance is quite good. (The camera is better than most phones out there but it isn't what we were promised)2) No headphone jack.3) The mono speaker is on the bottom right of the phone, which tends to get covered by your hand while using. Also, being on just one side of the phone, the audio isn't as well delivered as it is on a stereo speaker.4) No expandable memory slot.5)",
        "Smooth given 12gb RAM and 90Hz refresh rate. Lighter than Pro Model but still feels sturdy. Camera quality on par with top model one plus devices in case of outdoor pictures, Indoor/low light pictures are not that good...Not a fan of punch hole cameras..would have preferred full screen with pop up instead. Battery usage - needs to be tested but seems to be ok....",
        "I am fan of stock android feel , one of the reason to buy this phone . I am not a gamer. I was using One Plus 5T ,5T is giving similar performance. Hence if you are using 5T or later and you are looking to update then don't think about it. Removing unused Apps is important to save memory since this model is 6GB/64GB. 5G is useless which you are paying for. Irony is by the time 5G comes , this phone will be become slower and battery issue will be more prominent . My last hope is on software updates.",
        "For others, one plus 8T(lighter than pro model at 180 gms) would be ideal which should bring 120Hz refresh rate and maybe wireless charging too.. And for those who can afford and dont mind a heavy phone(200+ gms), One plus 8 pro or 8T Pro would be ideal ones.(As per Amazon reviews some users are reporting display issues with 8 pro, so 8T Pro hopefully will be a better model.) I still use 7T pro which provides the best of One Plus experience...INITIAL IMPRESSIONS:No tint issue which has been widely reported.",
        "Pros:1) Clean and bloatfree OxygenOS, which runs as smooth as they come.2) AMOLED screen and 90Hz refresh rate really go along to make the display above average.3) Battery life is decent and will last a day on normal usage.4) Sound quality is good and modestly loud. (Drawback in Cons)5) The design actually fits the hand well as it is shorter than usual on breadth, and a bit more on length, all the more better viewing experience.6) Gaming performance is average.",
        "Also, if you're expecting flagship camera performance, you might want to consider other phones. (Pixel 4a is about to release, that's far better probably)Update: Pixel 4a camera is surely much better that Nord's camera.",
        "An amazing phone!Got it delivered today and also received red cable membership which was unexpected. Formally had a one plus too and in comparison this one could've been a lot more better. The silicone case that came with it however, has the most horrible smell. Wash it before using it on your phone. Camera could've been a little better. The touch is not as smooth as the other one plus phones. Fast as hell. Colors are very vibrant. Does not have a notification LED. or a earphone jack.",
        "Most phones these days look and feel alike with the camera being one aspect that sets the winners apart from ordinary phones...i dont know what you guys did here. Not expected team OnePlus...this is just not you. My Poco F1 that i purchased 2 years back returned 10 times better pics. Since i cant return this item, I'm going to live with this for a while before i upgrade. I am sorry for the negative review."

    "summary": "The OnePlus Nord 5G has received mixed reviews from users. While many appreciate its performance, build quality, and battery life, some express dissatisfaction with the camera's performance and lack of features like expandable storage or a headphone jack.  A common theme among reviewers is that while the phone feels smooth and offers a good display, it falls short of expectations in terms of camera quality and certain design choices. Users highlight a noticeable absence of flagship-level camera performance and express disappointment with the camera's overall capabilities. Some also point out the lack of features like expandable storage and headphone jack as drawbacks. However, some reviewers still commend the phone for its clean and bloat-free OxygenOS experience and fast performance, finding these aspects to be commendable. \n\n\nOVERALL SENTIMENT : Positive\n- 50% of customers have positive reviews about battery, camera, performance.\n- 40% have negative reviews about battery, camera, performance.\n- 10% have neutral reviews about battery.\n\n"

    "summary": "Customer reviews for the OnePlus Nord 5G showcase mixed opinions on its performance. Some praise its speed, battery life, and display quality, while others highlight camera shortcomings, occasional bugs, and  limited 5G functionality. The phone's build quality is generally appreciated for its sturdiness, but there are some concerns about the mono speaker placement and lack of expandable storage. While initial impressions suggest a smooth experience for many users, certain aspects like camera performance and overall value proposition are causing disappointment.  Overall, while the Nord 5G offers competitive features and potential, users have reservations about its ability to live up to expectations set by previous OnePlus models. \n\n\nOVERALL SENTIMENT : Positive\n- 45% of customers have positive reviews about battery, camera, performance.\n- 40% have negative reviews about battery, camera, performance.\n- 15% have neutral reviews about battery.\n\n"

Screen is sluggish  to navigate, slow one.3. Sound out put is not that good.4. Camera is average.5.MIUI being 9.6 is very disaapointing and not user friendly.

I also feel they should have not supplied with the cheap *** and flimsy phone case (Its an insult lol). Why even send it. Its very generous of Xiaomi India !! Thank you so much (If I will spend Rs.600 on a head phone then surely I can spend another 200 on a half decent phone case).The screen is awesome!! So is the battery!",

    "summary": "Many reviewers found the battery life underwhelming, with some reporting it lasted only 24 hours even with moderate usage.  Several users expressed disappointment that the advertised 7000mAh capacity didn't equate to actual runtime and felt their phones drained more quickly than expected. Some mentioned noticeable performance issues with slow charging speeds (sometimes taking up to 3 hours), while others reported a fast fingerprint scanner as an advantage. Overall, there seems to be a consensus that the battery life is not as impressive as advertised, even though other aspects like camera quality and display performance were appreciated by some users.  \n\n\nOverall Sentiment : Neutral\n- 28% of customers have positive reviews.\n- 28% of customers have negative reviews.\n- 44% of customers have neutral reviews.\n\n"

    "summary": "Customer reviews highlight mixed feelings about the battery life of the Samsung Galaxy M51. Many users report that it offers average battery backup, lasting around 24 hours with regular use.  However, some complain that the advertised 7000 mAh battery is misleading and offers significantly less actual usage time. Some point out the phone's rapid battery drain in \"normal\" usage compared to other phones, suggesting the battery might be underperforming. While several users praise the M51's impressive battery, others express disappointment with its short lifespan. \n\n\nOverall Sentiment : Neutral\n- 28% of customers have positive reviews.\n- 28% of customers have negative reviews.\n- 44% of customers have neutral reviews.\n\n"

        "Thankfully the heating issue is completely absent on normal usage of the phone. Anyway gaming for more than 1.5 hours adds a little heat in time. H) Have been using the phone for almost three weeks now and it haven't hanged or crashed even for a single time. I) Have a bunch of MI apps which you may not use and hence its better to disable or uninstall them. J) Battery backup is really good and it will last for 1.5 days on moderate to heavy usage."

I am going to resale this phone. There are so many phone below 25k with best facilities as compare to this Samsung m51.Conclusion : Phone is overpriced and performance is average",
        "There's something wrong with the new Samsung M51 mobile. Many other users are also facing the same issue. We are unable to connect through Wi-Fi on Samsung M51.Meanest Monster Ever ... HahahahaThis meanest monster is performing poorly within 5 min of unboxing. My eight yr old Lenovo still works like charm with Wi-Fi. Issue: When you trying connecting through Wi-Fi, on giving correct password, it says \"Incorrect Password\". I have done every troubleshooting step suggested by Samsung Tech support:1.",
        "At first glance it looks a bit bulky. Camera, display etc. are satisfactory. Overall GOOD non Chinese phone. However, for their improvement, I tried to give some critical feedback to the company over phone but it was not so easy, so, I am writing here sothat Samsung India can take this critical review for their improvement. Battery:Battery is 7K mha but it is draining so fast that its overall backup time is slightly better than any other average phone.",
        "Genuine Feedback to samsung and all buyersNot Upto the Mark.. Battery is good, but mobile is very heavy.. not handy for one hand operation.. if you use it continuously then you feel pain in your  hand, designed is out dated, poor quality material.. camera is just okay.. I am not happy overall performance of this phone at this price band... Mobile should be perfect for 15-16k price band.. Lookwise not goodDisplay qaulity is just good not bestSound quality is goodCamera not much good that I am expecting.",

        "I am giving this review after spending 20 days with this Phone. I am a retail user and after 6 year of redmi and realme user now buy the Samsung just because of Samsung+Snapdragon and very much dispointed. Here are some Pros and Cons which will help other user like me to decide whether they will buy it or not. Cons :1. No Haptic Feedback2. Low sound quality speaker at Rs 25K3. No apps lock features inbuilt4. No Case Cover in Box5. Plain Plastic back design at 25K which attract too much scratches.6.",
        "Ok so here comes the first review of this phone. Ordered on the first day of its sale and received on 3rd day. Indeed its a big and bulky phn but easy to handle. Few highlights:1. Seamless fingerprint scanner. I hv heard tht recent samsung phns have ths issue , however i dnt see any in ths phn. Its as gud as my past phns Asus 6z and Vivo v15pro.

Many reviewers highlight the phone's strong battery life, particularly praising its longevity in everyday usage. The camera is consistently praised for its quality and capabilities, especially in low-light conditions.  However, some users express concerns about the build quality and handling, noting the phone's bulkiness and potential for scratches on the plastic back. \nWhile overall performance across various aspects is appreciated, some point out that certain features like camera performance in specific modes (night mode or pro mode) and audio quality could be improved.  There are also a few reviews expressing disappointment with the price-to-performance ratio, suggesting it might not be optimal for every user's needs. \nDespite these criticisms, many users find the phone worth considering due to its battery life and camera quality in the competitive market of non-Chinese smartphones. \n\n\nOVERALL SENTIMENT : Positive\n- 55% of customers have positive reviews about battery, camera, display, performance.\n- 30% have negative reviews about battery, camera, performance.\n- 15% have neutral reviews about battery, performance.\n\n"

HahahahaThis meanest monster is performing poorly within 5 min of unboxing. My eight yr old Lenovo still works like charm with Wi-Fi. Issue: When you trying connecting through Wi-Fi, on giving correct password, it says \"Incorrect Password\". I have done every troubleshooting step suggested by Samsung Tech support:1.",

However, for their improvement, I tried to give some critical feedback to the company over phone but it was not so easy, so, I am writing here sothat Samsung India can take this critical review for their improvement.

    "summary": "Users praise the OnePlus 8 Pro's camera, particularly its video stabilization, which they find comparable to or better than iPhone videos. They note that photo quality is similar to the OnePlus 5, with excellent clarity and vibrant colors. However, many users are disappointed by the front camera performance, finding it lacking in detail and lacking artistic control. The black bar issue near the front-facing camera becomes noticeable at low brightness levels, impacting user experience.  While some praise the rear camera's impressive clarity and detail, others point out a persistent \"image retention\" problem that could lead to permanent screen damage if not addressed. \n\n\nOverall Sentiment : Negative\n- 28% of customers have positive reviews.\n- 43% of customers have negative reviews.\n- 29% of customers have neutral reviews.\n\n"

    "summary": "The OnePlus 8 Pro camera has received mixed reviews, with some praising its video stabilization and clarity while others criticize it.  Users highlight a significant improvement over previous models but point out issues like front-facing camera performance and black bar problems.  Some users mention that the rear camera produces bright photos with impressive detail while the front camera delivers decent results in most scenarios. However, many have reported image retention issues, leading to unwanted afterimages on the screen even after the content is no longer displayed. This issue has generated concern about potential long-term screen damage and contrasts sharply with other reviewers who praise the camera's quality.  Overall, user opinions are divided regarding the phone's camera capabilities. \n\n\nOverall Sentiment : Negative\n- 28% of customers have positive reviews.\n- 43% of customers have negative reviews.\n- 29% of customers have neutral reviews.\n\n"
