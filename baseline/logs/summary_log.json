    "summary": "The Samsung Galaxy M01 Core generally receives positive feedback, highlighting its good build quality, performance, and camera features.  However, some users express disappointment with aspects like battery life, display clarity in low light conditions, and the lack of expandable storage. Certain users also experience occasional software issues like automatic restarts or limited camera functionality. Overall, the phone is considered a decent budget option, especially for those looking for a sleek design and good performance within their price range.  \n"

    "summary": "Customer feedback on the Samsung Galaxy M01 Core highlights a mix of positive and negative aspects:\n\n**Positives:** \n\n* **High praise for build quality, design, performance, camera (in good lighting), fast charging, user experience (Android and One UI)**\n* **Many enjoy the sleekness and convenience of the phone's size.**\n* **Positive experiences with display, sound quality,  and battery life are common.**\n* **Quick delivery from Amazon is appreciated.**\n\n**Negatives:**\n\n* **Battery life is a recurring concern**, even though it's considered a good performer in many reviews. \n* **Users often point to camera struggles in low light and occasional screen flickering/display quality issues.**  Some mention the \"auto-switching off\" feature as an issue, although this seems rare. \n* **Limited SD card slot and missing earphones in the box are mentioned as drawbacks.** \n\n**Overall:** The Samsung Galaxy M01 Core appears to be a well-received phone for its price point with several positive features but also some potential areas for improvement regarding battery life, camera performance, and user experience.  \n\n\nIt's worth noting that customer reviews can be subjective, and individual experiences may vary. \n"

    "summary": "Customers generally praise the Samsung Galaxy M01 Core for its excellent build quality, sleek design, and good camera performance (though it struggles with low light). Some note positive features like a large battery (6000 mAh), fast charging, and impressive display.  Concerns include occasional unexpected shutdowns, battery drain despite advertised capacity, and average overall performance compared to more expensive flagships like the OnePlus 7T.  Overall, the M01 Core appears to be a well-received budget option with some caveats for demanding users. \n"

    "summary": "The Samsung Galaxy M01 Core receives generally positive reviews, with users praising its build quality, design, camera (particularly for daylight shots), and fast updates.  However, some complaints include the battery life's inconsistency, occasional overheating, and mediocre display quality in low-light conditions.  Several reviewers highlight the improved performance compared to previous M series models. A notable point is that many users have experienced issues with the phone automatically switching off and on, although Samsung has addressed this. \n"

Good lighting conditions result in beautiful and detailed shots. Struggles a bit during the low light conditions. Overall quite ok for the price.4.\n- After 1 month Use1.Look and Build quality Good2. Camera Quality and feature mind blowing3. Battery 33w fast charger too good..charge 10 to 100% in just  40 to 45 minutes4. Ram management super.Good for multitasking...5. Display E3 Super Amoled,picture quality very nice stream any video in full HD like Amazon prime video, Netflix6. Audio output very clear and Loud7. Network Quality Good8. Lot of New AI feature provide in this phoneOverall This smartphone fulfill my all Technical Needs...Good work\n- Its not working. Pls don't buy this phone. Listen carefully, Only on August 14th 2020 I bought this, but today 23.08.2020 its not working. I couldn't even switch this mobile on. Samsung Galaxy M01 mobile. Mobile is not worth. As today I came to amazon for return or replacement this cheater has closed the return window by yesterday. How cunning they are ? not even ten days its been since I have bought. This cheaters have closed it. Its not working now. Even if I call toll free numbers no one responses.\n- The fault is from the end of Samsung company I suppose, because they should mention the process on the front page with bold letter. Most of the reviews which get 1 star facing the same problems like of mine. After using one month I want to add some extra points which impressed me.1. Sound quality and graphics are very good.2. Smooth touch sensitivity3. Ringtones are much louder.4.Two volte nano SIM s work fine together.5.Battery backup is good.\n- I received One Plus 7T 2 days back. I will describe you my experience in these 2 days.Firstly, kudos to Amazon for such a quick delivery and excellent packaging.Coming to the mobile, the first impression is just amazing. Its smooth, fast and you can't come out of it.The amoeld display is stunning and camera is amazing. Battery backup is also too good.\n- Video - Haven't really used much.Will update later3)Dolby speakers - Excellent sound quality with awesome stereo effect.Once again a huge upgrade over the older models.4)90 Hz refresh rate - Yes this one gives you a totally different experience when using your mobile.It is clearly faster and better than the usual 60Hz displays.5)Build and design - Just perfect...It's sleek...stylish and neat.\n- and i purchased this phone for my mom so quad core porcessor is sufficient to my mom.2:- Battry life is good because of Quad Core Processor.3:- Ram is 2Gb that is also sufficient4:- Display as always awesome as samsung provide.5:- Mike and Speaker's quality is too good as always samsung provide.6:- Many People said in the review that the mobile is automatically swiched off and on automatically. yes i have seen this my own only one time. but its not the problem.\n- Strongly recommend No..why samsung make lot advertise on m31s.really don't know wt makes new compared to other M series. 'Single take' shot option really useless.People who r looking for camera please don't buy m31s.All the modes camers pictures are 95%blur mode.perfomance of mobile is not up to expectations.When turns into selife mode really shocked IS IT HD photo or Asian paints colored WALL.REALLY SHOCKED.THIS TIME SAMSUNG DISAPPOINTED.Videos display is also not so effective.\n- (Using 8 GB ram variant)\u2206 WHAT'S INSIDE THE BOX \u2206The box looks like any other mobile phone box , nothing much fancy .Inside the box we get1) Device itself2)User manual and some paperwork.3)Dash charger and cable.\u2206 PROS\u22061) Design-It's a pro or con depending on each user's, if you look pass the Appleish design the build quality is amazing .It has curved back which feels really good when you hold it in hand.2)Top notch specs.3) Stock Android with minimal bloat and fast updates (I have received 3 till now)4)No-heating issues-I have used this device for many days and I must say this device barely heats up while doing intensive tasks, thanks to the Snapdragon 835.5) Excellent Camera-Day light photography is excellent but in low light it's a hit or a miss.6)Fast fingerprint scanner.\u2206CONS\u22061) Display is still Full hd2) Battery is not that great even with Full hd display (This could be fixed with an  software update)3)No Sd card slot.4) Price could have been less.Overall Iam pretty happy with the device and I highly recommend this to anyone over honor 8 pro.Thanks \u270c\ufe0f\n- Gifted it for my mother. It is perfect size , perfect placement of power and volume buttons, has dust on phone after opening the box but the box was sealed, same thing happened to me when I bought M31,Pros. * Perfect size* Samsung brand* Good build quality for this price* Android 10* One UI 2Cons. * camera is below average* Average display quality* No earphones in the box* No fingerprint scanner* Takes very long time to charge battery.Will update this review after few weeks.\n\n**Summary:**",
    "summary": "Customer feedback on the Samsung Galaxy M01 showcases a mixed bag of opinions.  Many praise its good build quality, performance (thanks to the Snapdragon 835 processor), and solid display. The camera, while decent in good light, struggles in low light conditions. Battery life is also a point of contention, with some users finding it underwhelming. While overall satisfaction is reported, concerns about display quality and battery longevity surface. However,  a general sentiment of positive reception emerges due to the phone's value for money proposition and its user-friendly Android experience. \n"

Some appreciate its ease of use, durability, good display, and solid performance for everyday tasks. There's also a general sentiment that this phone represents good value for money in the Indian market, especially against Chinese brands. \n\n**Negatives:** Concerns include slow charging time, camera quality not being as good as other phones in this price range, occasional automatic shutdowns, and inconsistent build quality (some experience issues with plastic body). Notably, some reviewers encounter difficulties using the phone after purchase.\n\n\nOverall, the Samsung Galaxy M01 is a decent budget option for those seeking a basic but reliable phone without sacrificing essential features. However, buyers should be aware of potential drawbacks and consider their individual needs before making a purchase.  \n"

Have all latest features like slow mo, 10x zoom, focus lens, panorma view and other added features.3. Battery ofcourse was the highlight while buying ths phn. I received this phn at 43%. And even after a rigorous 3 hr session of data transfer and apps installation it still holds at 33%.\n- Samsung trusted Knox security not fully enable on this phone i.e no secure folder option.7. When Sealed Package open then phone display contain so much dust. Not expected the packaging like this from brand like Samsung.8. Gorila Glass 3 protection under 25k i.e out dated glass protection after using 2 days with full care i got one scratch mark on display.9. NFC given but Samsung Pay not there in this phone.10.\n- Cons:_OverpricedBattery drain only fast in normal  uses give only  24 hours  backup.Sound quality  is so soBuild quality  is not goodPros:_Good processorGood  cameraUser interface  is goodFinger print sensor  working  very fast but some times missed out.After six days of uses, impressed  with camera performance, Display, fingerprint  working, and processor.Disappointed  with Battery  performance  my brother  realme 2 giving easily 2days battery  backup with 4250mah, but this phone is horrible in battery  backup  only  24 hours  with 7000.\n- At first glance it looks a bit bulky. Camera, display etc. are satisfactory.\n- There's something wrong with the new Samsung M51 mobile. Many other users are also facing the same issue. We are unable to connect through Wi-Fi on Samsung M51.Meanest Monster Ever ... HahahahaThis meanest monster is performing poorly within 5 min of unboxing. My eight yr old Lenovo still works like charm with Wi-Fi.Issue: When you trying connecting through Wi-Fi, on giving correct password, it says \"Incorrect Password\".I have done every troubleshooting step suggested by Samsung Tech support:1.\n- Audio output in my boat rockers bluetooth headset with this phone is not as much as lound as compare to my previous phone Redmi Note 7 pro.11. Without using phone it take 2 hour to charge but when you use it frequently then it take 2.30-3 hour to charged it full from 0-100%.12. Full battery drained in 12 hour with non stop used including youtube, whatsapp Facebook, messaging, etc except game.13.\n\n**Summary:**",
    "summary": "Customer feedback for the Samsung Galaxy M51 is mixed, highlighting both positives and negatives:\n\n**Positives:**\n\n* **Battery Life:**  Many users appreciate the long battery life (24 hours) with a 7000mAh capacity.\n* **Camera:** Users find the camera performance satisfactory, especially in good lighting conditions.\n* **Display & Fingerprint Scanner:** The display is praised for its quality, and the fingerprint scanner works quickly and accurately.\n* **Processor:**  Performance is generally good, handling multiple applications smoothly. \n\n**Negatives:**\n\n* **Build Quality and Design:**  Some complaints about the phone's bulky design and plastic back being prone to scratches. \n* **Overpriced:** Many feel the price-to-value ratio is poor compared to other phones in the market.\n* **Software/UI Issues:** The user interface, specifically for taking screenshots and access to certain settings, is criticized as needing improvement. \n* **Wi-Fi Connectivity**:  Users report difficulties connecting to Wi-Fi networks consistently.  \n* **Charging Time:** The charging time seems too slow at 2 hours for a full charge in standby mode, and even longer if using the phone actively. \n\n\n**Overall:** While there are positive aspects like battery life and camera performance, users are largely disappointed by the build quality, price, software shortcomings, and Wi-Fi connectivity issues.

I'm personally not a fan of notches nor do I click a lot of selfies, so I prefer the OnePlus 7T Pro's Fluid Display. Feels more luxurious over the 7T. It's marginally bigger to hold as well. I would recommend using a case so that the edges don't feel slippery.",
        "Loved the camera setup in OnePlus 7T but hated the circular bump.And I totally loved the edge display in OnePlus 7 pro.This device is just a perfect combination of the best features in the 7t and the 7pro and NOT an unwanted model like everyone is claiming.6) Batter and charging - The charging is blazing fast and the battery very easily lasts a whole day,even with 90Hz refresh rate.",

My experience so far with this:1. Display: It's amazing. Sharpness, brightness and 90Hz displays makes it one of the most beautiful displays.2. Camera: All of my previous mobiles had great cameras. 7t Pro is nothing less than that.",

Go for users reviews who bought them with their own money.",
        "This phone has great performance, good camera and ambiance. Charging is fast as per the Oneplus standards set in earlier phones.

        "Maybe their R&D or trials have some problem here that in every two months they are launching a new device with an update to the previous faults. Like OnePlus 7 has voice receiver on one side which is right. So if you take calls or hear the phone from left you won't get a clear voice or volume. So they added receivers on both the side in this device.I am still not getting why I have spent Rs 40,000 on it.",
        "However, you should also note that in different lighting conditions, 7T Pro has glares at the curves due to the rounder corners which I believe is negligible. 90Hz is smoooooth.

You can't take screenshot easily.",

Seamless fingerprint scanner. I hv heard tht recent samsung phns have ths issue , however i dnt see any in ths phn. Its as gud as my past phns Asus 6z and Vivo v15pro. Side fingerprint scanner on the power button really makes it stylish and too easy to handle as well.2.",
        "I am giving this review after spending 20 days with this Phone. I am a retail user and after 6 year of redmi and realme user now buy the Samsung just because of Samsung+Snapdragon and very much dispointed. Here are some Pros and Cons which will help other user like me to decide whether they will buy it or not.Cons :1. No Haptic Feedback2. Low sound quality speaker at Rs 25K3. No apps lock features inbuilt4. No Case Cover in Box5. Plain Plastic back design at 25K which attract too much scratches.6.",
        "I found it reliable for my 1920p to 4k level of movie watching without any distraction due to Infinite O display which gives Full Screen Ratio. Fingerprint on side is much faster than I expected. It doesn't takes a second also to open. Even FaceUnlock is faster.Superior, as it matches any S series flagship premium in classy look, strong built for this budget amount. 6.7 inches display is good to handle as it is well managed for one hand use also.",

Wonderful touch and a decent processimg speed. I tried playing 7-8 apps at the same time and it never hanged or lagged despite 50% memory up. Yet to try on heavy games though.6. Front cam does spoil the fun while watching full screen videos, like a small black dot bt can be lived wth.7. No headphones in the box.8.",

But this easy method for taking screenshot is not easy to find in its setting section. Automatic redial isn't available. also in setting section, searching for basic operation like redial, call waiting etc are either missing or very difficult to access.

You can't take screenshot easily.\n- In this price segment, Samsung can easily provide metallic back for better appearance and transfer of heat.Overall, its good non chini phone with good camera and display, a bit bulky, satisfactory speed, scope of tremendous improvement in UI and setting, and bit overpriced.\n- When you focus on Sky whole pic turn into blue. i.e saturation level is too much high in this phone (Image attached).16. While watching movie video in this phone or playing video in youtube brightness fluctuate fast too much automatically i.e Adaptive Brightness issue.Pros :1. Super amoled plus display2. Camera quality Good3. 7000 Mah battery4.\n- No Carrier aggregation: Using Jio sim in Samsung M51 and realme X2 pro and both contain different net speed in which Samsung giving me 5mbps and realme x2 pro giving me 9-10mbps.14. Calling issue: while talking through ear piece on call, the person can hear my voice clearly. But if i put the call on loudspeaker, the receiver of call cant hear my voice or he hear my sound very low. Turning back to earpiece the person is able to hear me again.15. Camera Zoom quality is not good.\n- Awesome camera Awesome battery Awesome display  ....Super clear ZoomSuper Macro sensorSuper ultrawide angleAtlast Thanks Samsung for 730G\n- Ok so here comes the first review of this phone. Ordered on the first day of its sale and received on 3rd day. Indeed its a big and bulky phn but easy to handle. Few highlights:1. Seamless fingerprint scanner. I hv heard tht recent samsung phns have ths issue , however i dnt see any in ths phn. Its as gud as my past phns Asus 6z and Vivo v15pro. Side fingerprint scanner on the power button really makes it stylish and too easy to handle as well.2.\n- I am giving this review after spending 20 days with this Phone. I am a retail user and after 6 year of redmi and realme user now buy the Samsung just because of Samsung+Snapdragon and very much dispointed. Here are some Pros and Cons which will help other user like me to decide whether they will buy it or not.Cons :1. No Haptic Feedback2. Low sound quality speaker at Rs 25K3. No apps lock features inbuilt4. No Case Cover in Box5. Plain Plastic back design at 25K which attract too much scratches.6.\n- I found it reliable for my 1920p to 4k level of movie watching without any distraction due to Infinite O display which gives Full Screen Ratio. Fingerprint on side is much faster than I expected. It doesn't takes a second also to open. Even FaceUnlock is faster.Superior, as it matches any S series flagship premium in classy look, strong built for this budget amount. 6.7 inches display is good to handle as it is well managed for one hand use also.\n- This is a perfect mobile for you,1. If you properly read the spec before buying this mobile2. If you don't expect all iPhone features in this mobile,3. if you are not a addictive gamer,4. If you don't expect your mobile to be a speaker,5. If you do concern about your data handled in Chinese mobiles,6. If you need better SAR value,7. If your first preference is battery, and decent level of camera quality,8.\n- Camera quality is really gud wth many features which luks tempting which im yet to explore. Even in dim light it scores quite well. Have all latest features like slow mo, 10x zoom, focus lens, panorma view and other added features.3. Battery ofcourse was the highlight while buying ths phn. I received this phn at 43%. And even after a rigorous 3 hr session of data transfer and apps installation it still holds at 33%.\n- At first glance it looks a bit bulky. Camera, display etc. are satisfactory.\n- I believe it gonna last 2 days easily wth heavy net usage , mild games and gud 2 hrs of talk time.4. Luks wise it does seem premium despite a plastic back.5. Wonderful touch and a decent processimg speed. I tried playing 7-8 apps at the same time and it never hanged or lagged despite 50% memory up. Yet to try on heavy games though.6. Front cam does spoil the fun while watching full screen videos, like a small black dot bt can be lived wth.7. No headphones in the box.8.\n- You need to learn fine motor coordination between your fingers and power&volume button with microsecond precision. After three days I discovered taking screenshot by swapping screen. But this easy method for taking screenshot is not easy to find in its setting section. Automatic redial isn't available. also in setting section, searching for basic operation like redial, call waiting etc are either missing or very difficult to access. UI should be more intelligent and intuitive.\n- Cons:_OverpricedBattery drain only fast in normal  uses give only  24 hours  backup.Sound quality  is so soBuild quality  is not goodPros:_Good processorGood  cameraUser interface  is goodFinger print sensor  working  very fast but some times missed out.After six days of uses, impressed  with camera performance, Display, fingerprint  working, and processor.Disappointed  with Battery  performance  my brother  realme 2 giving easily 2days battery  backup with 4250mah, but this phone is horrible in battery  backup  only  24 hours  with 7000.\n- It has issue with camera in night mode and pro mode.It seems like there is dust present on camera sensor which is only visible in dark photos. When photo is clicked with lens covered completely,  it shows hundreds of white spots in image, same happens with pro mode too.

    "summary": "The Samsung Galaxy M51 receives mixed feedback from users. \n\n**Positives:**\n\n* **Camera quality is good** with attractive features, including macro and ultra-wide lens.\n* **Battery life is strong,** offering decent runtime even with heavy usage.\n* **Display quality is excellent,** with a vivid Super Amoled Plus display for viewing movies and multimedia content.\n* **Fingerprint scanner is fast and convenient**,  and the phone generally feels well-made for its price point. \n\n**Negatives:**\n\n* **Wi-Fi connectivity is frequently unreliable.** Many users report issues connecting to Wi-Fi networks, which detracts from a smooth user experience.\n* **Software performance has been criticized**, with complaints about UI complexity, lag, and frequent app crashes. The camera also suffers in low-light situations. \n* **Build quality feels average** with many noting the plastic back is prone to scratches.  Battery drain is also a significant issue for some users, especially when compared to competitors.\n* **User interface is a point of contention.** Some find the UI difficult and slow, with limited accessibility options.\n\n\nOverall, the Samsung Galaxy M51 offers a strong camera, good battery life, and fast fingerprint scanner at a competitive price.  However, Wi-Fi connectivity issues, performance complaints, and inconsistent build quality leave room for improvement. \n"

Now in M51 feature of Widevine L Certification you can enjoy all those global Dolby theatre experience.\n- Genuine Feedback to samsung and all buyersNot Upto the Mark..Battery is good, but mobile is very heavy.. not handy for one hand operation.. if you use it continuously then you feel pain in your  hand, designed is out dated, poor quality material.. camera is just okay..I am not happy overall performance of this phone at this price band...Mobile should be perfect for 15-16k price band..Lookwise not goodDisplay qaulity is just good not bestSound quality is goodCamera not much good that I am expecting.Big screen which perfect for movie watcher.. but after 30 minutes you feel pain in your hands.I bought Electric blue colour, it's look like samsung old samrt phone .My request to Amazon, is it possible to return this mobile.\n- Overall GOOD non Chinese phone.However, for their improvement, I tried to give some critical feedback to the company over phone but it was not so easy, so, I am writing here sothat Samsung India can take this critical review for their improvement.Battery:Battery is 7K mha but it is draining so fast that its overall backup time is slightly better than any other average phone.User Interface:User interface needs tremendous improvement. You can't take screenshot easily.\n- In this price segment, Samsung can easily provide metallic back for better appearance and transfer of heat.Overall, its good non chini phone with good camera and display, a bit bulky, satisfactory speed, scope of tremendous improvement in UI and setting, and bit overpriced.\n- When you focus on Sky whole pic turn into blue. i.e saturation level is too much high in this phone (Image attached).16. While watching movie video in this phone or playing video in youtube brightness fluctuate fast too much automatically i.e Adaptive Brightness issue.Pros :1. Super amoled plus display2. Camera quality Good3. 7000 Mah battery4.\n- No Carrier aggregation: Using Jio sim in Samsung M51 and realme X2 pro and both contain different net speed in which Samsung giving me 5mbps and realme x2 pro giving me 9-10mbps.14. Calling issue: while talking through ear piece on call, the person can hear my voice clearly. But if i put the call on loudspeaker, the receiver of call cant hear my voice or he hear my sound very low. Turning back to earpiece the person is able to hear me again.15. Camera Zoom quality is not good.\n- Awesome camera Awesome battery Awesome display  ....Super clear ZoomSuper Macro sensorSuper ultrawide angleAtlast Thanks Samsung for 730G\n- Ok so here comes the first review of this phone. Ordered on the first day of its sale and received on 3rd day. Indeed its a big and bulky phn but easy to handle. Few highlights:1. Seamless fingerprint scanner. I hv heard tht recent samsung phns have ths issue , however i dnt see any in ths phn. Its as gud as my past phns Asus 6z and Vivo v15pro. Side fingerprint scanner on the power button really makes it stylish and too easy to handle as well.2.\n- I am giving this review after spending 20 days with this Phone. I am a retail user and after 6 year of redmi and realme user now buy the Samsung just because of Samsung+Snapdragon and very much dispointed. Here are some Pros and Cons which will help other user like me to decide whether they will buy it or not.Cons :1. No Haptic Feedback2. Low sound quality speaker at Rs 25K3. No apps lock features inbuilt4. No Case Cover in Box5. Plain Plastic back design at 25K which attract too much scratches.6.\n- I found it reliable for my 1920p to 4k level of movie watching without any distraction due to Infinite O display which gives Full Screen Ratio. Fingerprint on side is much faster than I expected. It doesn't takes a second also to open. Even FaceUnlock is faster.Superior, as it matches any S series flagship premium in classy look, strong built for this budget amount. 6.7 inches display is good to handle as it is well managed for one hand use also.\n- This is a perfect mobile for you,1. If you properly read the spec before buying this mobile2. If you don't expect all iPhone features in this mobile,3. if you are not a addictive gamer,4. If you don't expect your mobile to be a speaker,5. If you do concern about your data handled in Chinese mobiles,6. If you need better SAR value,7. If your first preference is battery, and decent level of camera quality,8.\n- Camera quality is really gud wth many features which luks tempting which im yet to explore. Even in dim light it scores quite well. Have all latest features like slow mo, 10x zoom, focus lens, panorma view and other added features.3. Battery ofcourse was the highlight while buying ths phn. I received this phn at 43%. And even after a rigorous 3 hr session of data transfer and apps installation it still holds at 33%.\n- At first glance it looks a bit bulky. Camera, display etc. are satisfactory.\n- I believe it gonna last 2 days easily wth heavy net usage , mild games and gud 2 hrs of talk time.4. Luks wise it does seem premium despite a plastic back.5. Wonderful touch and a decent processimg speed. I tried playing 7-8 apps at the same time and it never hanged or lagged despite 50% memory up. Yet to try on heavy games though.6. Front cam does spoil the fun while watching full screen videos, like a small black dot bt can be lived wth.7. No headphones in the box.8.\n- You need to learn fine motor coordination between your fingers and power&volume button with microsecond precision. After three days I discovered taking screenshot by swapping screen. But this easy method for taking screenshot is not easy to find in its setting section. Automatic redial isn't available. also in setting section, searching for basic operation like redial, call waiting etc are either missing or very difficult to access. UI should be more intelligent and intuitive.\n- Cons:_OverpricedBattery drain only fast in normal  uses give only  24 hours  backup.Sound quality  is so soBuild quality  is not goodPros:_Good processorGood  cameraUser interface  is goodFinger print sensor  working  very fast but some times missed out.After six days of uses, impressed  with camera performance, Display, fingerprint  working, and processor.Disappointed  with Battery  performance  my brother  realme 2 giving easily 2days battery  backup with 4250mah, but this phone is horrible in battery  backup  only  24 hours  with 7000.\n- It has issue with camera in night mode and pro mode.It seems like there is dust present on camera sensor which is only visible in dark photos.

    "summary": "Customer feedback on the Samsung Galaxy M51 is mixed. While there are positive aspects like impressive camera quality, a large screen (good for movies), and decent battery life, several issues arise:\n\n* **Wi-Fi connectivity problems:** Many users report Wi-Fi connection issues.\n* **Battery drain:** Battery life is criticized as being insufficient, even with moderate usage. \n* **Performance:** Some users find the phone to be slow and laggy even after multitasking.  \n* **User interface:** Some find the user interface frustrating, lacking intuitive features and clear navigation. \n* **Camera performance:** Camera functionality isn't universally praised; night mode and professional modes are reported to have issues.\n\n\nIn conclusion, while the M51 has some redeeming qualities, it suffers from significant drawbacks that leave users dissatisfied with the overall experience and pricing.  Repair options for faulty hardware are available through Samsung service centers but require a trip to a repair center rather than an at-home fix. \n"

Some find it bulky, the plastic back prone to scratches, and the lack of a headphone jack frustrating.\n* **Battery drain is an issue** for some, leading to a shorter battery life compared to competitors. \n* **User interface shortcomings**:  Several users mention difficulty finding specific functions like redial and screenshot options in the settings menu, highlighting a need for improvement.  \n* **Camera performance in low-light and pro mode appears inconsistent**, with dust on the sensor being an identified issue.\n\n\n**In short:** The Samsung Galaxy M51 offers strong points in display, camera, and battery life. However, connectivity problems, design flaws, inconsistent app"

Now in M51 feature of Widevine L Certification you can enjoy all those global Dolby theatre experience.\n- Genuine Feedback to samsung and all buyersNot Upto the Mark..Battery is good, but mobile is very heavy.. not handy for one hand operation.. if you use it continuously then you feel pain in your  hand, designed is out dated, poor quality material.. camera is just okay..I am not happy overall performance of this phone at this price band...Mobile should be perfect for 15-16k price band..Lookwise not goodDisplay qaulity is just good not bestSound quality is goodCamera not much good that I am expecting.Big screen which perfect for movie watcher.. but after 30 minutes you feel pain in your hands.I bought Electric blue colour, it's look like samsung old samrt phone .My request to Amazon, is it possible to return this mobile.\n- Overall GOOD non Chinese phone.However, for their improvement, I tried to give some critical feedback to the company over phone but it was not so easy, so, I am writing here sothat Samsung India can take this critical review for their improvement.Battery:Battery is 7K mha but it is draining so fast that its overall backup time is slightly better than any other average phone.User Interface:User interface needs tremendous improvement. You can't take screenshot easily.\n- In this price segment, Samsung can easily provide metallic back for better appearance and transfer of heat.Overall, its good non chini phone with good camera and display, a bit bulky, satisfactory speed, scope of tremendous improvement in UI and setting, and bit overpriced.\n- When you focus on Sky whole pic turn into blue. i.e saturation level is too much high in this phone (Image attached).16. While watching movie video in this phone or playing video in youtube brightness fluctuate fast too much automatically i.e Adaptive Brightness issue.Pros :1. Super amoled plus display2.

Calling issue: while talking through ear piece on call, the person can hear my voice clearly. But if i put the call on loudspeaker, the receiver of call cant hear my voice or he hear my sound very low. Turning back to earpiece the person is able to hear me again.15. Camera Zoom quality is not good.\n- Awesome camera Awesome battery Awesome display  ....Super clear ZoomSuper Macro sensorSuper ultrawide angleAtlast Thanks Samsung for 730G\n- Ok so here comes the first review of this phone. Ordered on the first day of its sale and received on 3rd day. Indeed its a big and bulky phn but easy to handle. Few highlights:1. Seamless fingerprint scanner. I hv heard tht recent samsung phns have ths issue , however i dnt see any in ths phn. Its as gud as my past phns Asus 6z and Vivo v15pro. Side fingerprint scanner on the power button really makes it stylish and too easy to handle as well.2.\n- I am giving this review after spending 20 days with this Phone. I am a retail user and after 6 year of redmi and realme user now buy the Samsung just because of Samsung+Snapdragon and very much dispointed. Here are some Pros and Cons which will help other user like me to decide whether they will buy it or not.Cons :1. No Haptic Feedback2. Low sound quality speaker at Rs 25K3. No apps lock features inbuilt4. No Case Cover in Box5. Plain Plastic back design at 25K which attract too much scratches.6.\n- I found it reliable for my 1920p to 4k level of movie watching without any distraction due to Infinite O display which gives Full Screen Ratio. Fingerprint on side is much faster than I expected. It doesn't takes a second also to open. Even FaceUnlock is faster.Superior, as it matches any S series flagship premium in classy look, strong built for this budget amount. 6.7 inches display is good to handle as it is well managed for one hand use also.\n- This is a perfect mobile for you,1. If you properly read the spec before buying this mobile2. If you don't expect all iPhone features in this mobile,3. if you are not a addictive gamer,4. If you don't expect your mobile to be a speaker,5. If you do concern about your data handled in Chinese mobiles,6. If you need better SAR value,7. If your first preference is battery, and decent level of camera quality,8.\n- Camera quality is really gud wth many features which luks tempting which im yet to explore. Even in dim light it scores quite well. Have all latest features like slow mo, 10x zoom, focus lens, panorma view and other added features.3. Battery ofcourse was the highlight while buying ths phn. I received this phn at 43%. And even after a rigorous 3 hr session of data transfer and apps installation it still holds at 33%.\n- At first glance it looks a bit bulky. Camera, display etc. are satisfactory.\n- I believe it gonna last 2 days easily wth heavy net usage , mild games and gud 2 hrs of talk time.4. Luks wise it does seem premium despite a plastic back.5. Wonderful touch and a decent processimg speed. I tried playing 7-8 apps at the same time and it never hanged or lagged despite 50% memory up. Yet to try on heavy games though.6. Front cam does spoil the fun while watching full screen videos, like a small black dot bt can be lived wth.7. No headphones in the box.8.\n- You need to learn fine motor coordination between your fingers and power&volume button with microsecond precision. After three days I discovered taking screenshot by swapping screen. But this easy method for taking screenshot is not easy to find in its setting section. Automatic redial isn't available. also in setting section, searching for basic operation like redial, call waiting etc are either missing or very difficult to access. UI should be more intelligent and intuitive.\n- Cons:_OverpricedBattery drain only fast in normal  uses give only  24 hours  backup.Sound quality  is so soBuild quality  is not goodPros:_Good processorGood  cameraUser interface  is goodFinger print sensor  working  very fast but some times missed out.After six days of uses, impressed  with camera performance, Display, fingerprint  working, and processor.Disappointed  with Battery  performance  my brother  realme 2 giving easily 2days battery  backup with 4250mah, but this phone is horrible in battery  backup  only  24 hours  with 7000.\n- It has issue with camera in night mode and pro mode.It seems like there is dust present on camera sensor which is only visible in dark photos. When photo is clicked with lens covered completely,  it shows hundreds of white spots in image, same happens with pro mode too. (This is not regular image noise)\n- Factory Data ResetI have applied every step suggested by tech-support and the result is still the same.The most irritating thing is how can a company like Samsung mess-up such a basic feature & to the surprise, even the tech support has now run out of troubleshooting solutions.Instead of replacing it with new phone, tech support has now told me to get the hardware fixed from Samsung Service centre. I don't get it why should I take a brand new phone to service center & get it opened.\n\n**Summary:**",

A few highlight concerns include **app freezing**, \"**missed calls due to low volume\"** and **\"difficulty taking screenshots\".** Overall, there is an expectation that the phone's price point doesn't justify its shortcomings, particularly for users coming from lower-priced brands. \n"

    "summary": "Customer feedback for the Samsung Galaxy M51 reveals mixed opinions on its performance and features. \n\n**Positives:** Many appreciate the camera quality, especially in low-light conditions, with some highlighting the super AMOLED display's clarity.  The battery life is also lauded. The fingerprint scanner is frequently praised as fast and reliable, while the phone generally performs well for everyday tasks, even multitasking. \n\n**Negatives:** A significant portion of users express disappointment with Wi-Fi connectivity issues and general performance. Complaints about camera performance in night mode and pro mode highlight technical flaws.  Battery life falls short of expectations, and there is concern regarding sound quality. The user interface has faced criticism for its lack of intuitiveness, particularly in terms of screenshots and redial functions.   Some find the phone bulky and overpriced for its specifications, while others appreciate Samsung's effort on premium design at an affordable price point. \n\n\n**Overall:** Users are divided between positive aspects and significant shortcomings.  There is a clear call for improvement across various features, including Wi-Fi connectivity, camera functionality in certain modes, and user interface streamlining. \n"

Even FaceUnlock is faster.Superior, as it matches any S series flagship premium in classy look, strong built for this budget amount. 6.7 inches display is good to handle as it is well managed for one hand use also.\n- This is a perfect mobile for you,1. If you properly read the spec before buying this mobile2. If you don't expect all iPhone features in this mobile,3. if you are not a addictive gamer,4. If you don't expect your mobile to be a speaker,5. If you do concern about your data handled in Chinese mobiles,6. If you need better SAR value,7. If your first preference is battery, and decent level of camera quality,8.\n- Camera quality is really gud wth many features which luks tempting which im yet to explore. Even in dim light it scores quite well. Have all latest features like slow mo, 10x zoom, focus lens, panorma view and other added features.3. Battery ofcourse was the highlight while buying ths phn. I received this phn at 43%. And even after a rigorous 3 hr session of data transfer and apps installation it still holds at 33%.\n- At first glance it looks a bit bulky. Camera, display etc. are satisfactory.\n- I believe it gonna last 2 days easily wth heavy net usage , mild games and gud 2 hrs of talk time.4. Luks wise it does seem premium despite a plastic back.5. Wonderful touch and a decent processimg speed. I tried playing 7-8 apps at the same time and it never hanged or lagged despite 50% memory up. Yet to try on heavy games though.6. Front cam does spoil the fun while watching full screen videos, like a small black dot bt can be lived wth.7. No headphones in the box.8.\n- You need to learn fine motor coordination between your fingers and power&volume button with microsecond precision. After three days I discovered taking screenshot by swapping screen. But this easy method for taking screenshot is not easy to find in its setting section. Automatic redial isn't available. also in setting section, searching for basic operation like redial, call waiting etc are either missing or very difficult to access. UI should be more intelligent and intuitive.\n- Cons:_OverpricedBattery drain only fast in normal  uses give only  24 hours  backup.Sound quality  is so soBuild quality  is not goodPros:_Good processorGood  cameraUser interface  is goodFinger print sensor  working  very fast but some times missed out.After six days of uses, impressed  with camera performance, Display, fingerprint  working, and processor.Disappointed  with Battery  performance  my brother  realme 2 giving easily 2days battery  backup with 4250mah, but this phone is horrible in battery  backup  only  24 hours  with 7000.\n- It has issue with camera in night mode and pro mode.It seems like there is dust present on camera sensor which is only visible in dark photos. When photo is clicked with lens covered completely,  it shows hundreds of white spots in image, same happens with pro mode too. (This is not regular image noise)\n- Factory Data ResetI have applied every step suggested by tech-support and the result is still the same.The most irritating thing is how can a company like Samsung mess-up such a basic feature & to the surprise, even the tech support has now run out of troubleshooting solutions.Instead of replacing it with new phone, tech support has now told me to get the hardware fixed from Samsung Service centre. I don't get it why should I take a brand new phone to service center & get it opened.\n\n**Summary:**",
    "summary": "Customer feedback on the Samsung Galaxy M51 is mixed.  While some highlight its **good camera, large display, and long battery life**, others express concerns about **performance issues (Wi-Fi connectivity, call quality), design flaws (plastic back, lack of headphone jack), and software shortcomings (UI complexity, missing features)**.  \n\n**Common complaints include:**\n\n* **Weak Wi-Fi connection:** Many users encounter persistent connection problems.\n* **Poor performance in some areas:** Some find the phone lags when multitasking or experiencing high data usage. \n* **Heavy weight and uncomfortable grip:** Some users find the phone bulky and difficult to hold for extended periods, especially while one-handed operation.\n* **Inconsistent app redial function:**  The automatic redial feature is either missing or inaccessible in some situations. \n* **Camera issues in specific modes:** Night mode and pro mode exhibit problems with dust affecting image quality.\n\n\nOverall, customers find the phone to be a decent value for money, particularly for its battery life and camera capabilities. However, there's a clear consensus that Samsung needs to address software and design flaws to improve overall user experience and justify the higher price point. \n"

    "summary": "The Samsung Galaxy M51 is generally considered average in terms of performance, with some users experiencing issues like Wi-Fi connectivity problems and battery drainage. Many appreciate the large display, camera features (including macro and zoom), and overall design, but criticisms focus on pricing, bulky build, lack of certain features (like haptic feedback or app lock), and potential data security concerns regarding Chinese components.  Overall, it seems there's a mixed bag of opinions with some positive aspects outweighing the negative points for many users. \n"

I'm personally not a fan of notches nor do I click a lot of selfies, so I prefer the OnePlus 7T Pro's Fluid Display. Feels more luxurious over the 7T. It's marginally bigger to hold as well. I would recommend using a case so that the edges don't feel slippery.",
        "No camera quality, no battery life, no sound quality on calls, getting wounds on holding it for long.I have always recommended OnePlus devices to everyone around and had high hopes and trust on the brand that I bought it on the day of the launch but with this experience, I won't recommend OnePlus 7t to my colleagues and friends who are planning to upgrade their devices.",

        "Amazing phone with an unbelievably smooth and vivid display.I had been using the OnePlus 5T before and a big fan of OnePlus cameras and OS.But I've always felt the OnePlus display wasn't good enough.This mobile just killed that thought.Highlights:1)Buttery smooth, fast and bright display -The edge display is just wowwww. You just can't stop admiring it.2)Excellent camera - The pictures come out so well in all kinds of lighting and modes.",
        "I received One Plus 7T 2 days back. I will describe you my experience in these 2 days.Firstly, kudos to Amazon for such a quick delivery and excellent packaging.Coming to the mobile, the first impression is just amazing. Its smooth, fast and you can't come out of it.The amoeld display is stunning and camera is amazing. Battery backup is also too good.",
        "However, you should also note that in different lighting conditions, 7T Pro has glares at the curves due to the rounder corners which I believe is negligible. 90Hz is smoooooth. You would never want to get back to 60Hz once you're used to this.==== Performance ====Snapdragon 855 Plus is one of the best CPUs out there (at the time of writing this review) and with Adrena 640, it takes gaming and multi-tasking to another league. COD & PUB-G juices out at their best with 60FPS & is indeed smooth than imagined."

    "summary": "The OnePlus 7T Pro generally receives positive feedback for its display, camera quality, fast charging, and overall performance. Some users experience issues with battery life and occasional software glitches. There is a general consensus that the phone offers a significant upgrade over previous models and is particularly well-suited for those seeking a flagship-level device with minimal notches. However, some criticisms highlight potential drawbacks like screen glare in specific lighting conditions, a slight drop in battery life compared to expectations, and issues with notification management on certain devices.  \n"

    "summary": "The OnePlus 7T Pro generally receives positive reviews, particularly for its display (which boasts a vibrant 90Hz refresh rate), camera quality, and fast charging capabilities. However, some users report issues with software performance and battery life, with complaints of heating problems and inconsistent notifications. Some mention the phone feels slippery compared to previous models, but appreciate the slimmer design and the overall smooth user experience.  A few reviews note that while this is an incremental upgrade over the 7 Pro, it might be worth considering the 7 Pro for those seeking better value or a more seamless experience before committing to the 7T Pro's newer features. Overall, there are both positive and negative aspects, with users finding the phone's performance to be excellent in terms of its speed, graphics, and camera quality.  \n"

Seamless fingerprint scanner. I hv heard tht recent samsung phns have ths issue , however i dnt see any in ths phn. Its as gud as my past phns Asus 6z and Vivo v15pro. Side fingerprint scanner on the power button really makes it stylish and too easy to handle as well.2.",
        "I am giving this review after spending 20 days with this Phone. I am a retail user and after 6 year of redmi and realme user now buy the Samsung just because of Samsung+Snapdragon and very much dispointed. Here are some Pros and Cons which will help other user like me to decide whether they will buy it or not.Cons :1. No Haptic Feedback2. Low sound quality speaker at Rs 25K3. No apps lock features inbuilt4. No Case Cover in Box5. Plain Plastic back design at 25K which attract too much scratches.6.",
        "I found it reliable for my 1920p to 4k level of movie watching without any distraction due to Infinite O display which gives Full Screen Ratio. Fingerprint on side is much faster than I expected. It doesn't takes a second also to open. Even FaceUnlock is faster.Superior, as it matches any S series flagship premium in classy look, strong built for this budget amount. 6.7 inches display is good to handle as it is well managed for one hand use also.",

If your first preference is battery, and decent level of camera quality,8.",

Have all latest features like slow mo, 10x zoom, focus lens, panorma view and other added features.3. Battery ofcourse was the highlight while buying ths phn. I received this phn at 43%. And even after a rigorous 3 hr session of data transfer and apps installation it still holds at 33%.",

Camera Zoom quality is not good.\n- Awesome camera Awesome battery Awesome display  ....Super clear ZoomSuper Macro sensorSuper ultrawide angleAtlast Thanks Samsung for 730G\n- Ok so here comes the first review of this phone. Ordered on the first day of its sale and received on 3rd day. Indeed its a big and bulky phn but easy to handle. Few highlights:1. Seamless fingerprint scanner. I hv heard tht recent samsung phns have ths issue , however i dnt see any in ths phn. Its as gud as my past phns Asus 6z and Vivo v15pro. Side fingerprint scanner on the power button really makes it stylish and too easy to handle as well.2.\n- I am giving this review after spending 20 days with this Phone. I am a retail user and after 6 year of redmi and realme user now buy the Samsung just because of Samsung+Snapdragon and very much dispointed. Here are some Pros and Cons which will help other user like me to decide whether they will buy it or not.Cons :1. No Haptic Feedback2. Low sound quality speaker at Rs 25K3. No apps lock features inbuilt4. No Case Cover in Box5. Plain Plastic back design at 25K which attract too much scratches.6.\n- I found it reliable for my 1920p to 4k level of movie watching without any distraction due to Infinite O display which gives Full Screen Ratio. Fingerprint on side is much faster than I expected. It doesn't takes a second also to open. Even FaceUnlock is faster.Superior, as it matches any S series flagship premium in classy look, strong built for this budget amount. 6.7 inches display is good to handle as it is well managed for one hand use also.\n- This is a perfect mobile for you,1. If you properly read the spec before buying this mobile2. If you don't expect all iPhone features in this mobile,3. if you are not a addictive gamer,4. If you don't expect your mobile to be a speaker,5. If you do concern about your data handled in Chinese mobiles,6. If you need better SAR value,7. If your first preference is battery, and decent level of camera quality,8.\n- Camera quality is really gud wth many features which luks tempting which im yet to explore. Even in dim light it scores quite well. Have all latest features like slow mo, 10x zoom, focus lens, panorma view and other added features.3. Battery ofcourse was the highlight while buying ths phn. I received this phn at 43%. And even after a rigorous 3 hr session of data transfer and apps installation it still holds at 33%.\n- At first glance it looks a bit bulky. Camera, display etc. are satisfactory.\n\n**Summary:**",
    "summary": "The Samsung Galaxy M51 is generally considered average, with mixed reviews regarding its performance and features. Some users praise the camera, battery life, and display quality.  However, many complain about Wi-Fi connectivity issues, a heavy design that's difficult to handle for one hand use, and inconsistent app/voice call clarity, along with underwhelming speed in comparison to other competitors. Overall, while some find it appealing due to its features, the price point is considered high compared to similar devices offering better value for money. \n"

Some express disappointment with the phone's price point considering the perceived limitations, while others highlight the high-quality speakers and fingerprint scanner. Overall, the M51 offers a balanced package but falls short in some areas compared to competitors.  \n"

    "summary": "Customer feedback on the Samsung Galaxy M51 reveals mixed opinions regarding its performance and value for money.  Many praise the camera (particularly in low light), battery life, and display quality. However, users report Wi-Fi connectivity issues and voice call clarity problems. Some criticize its design, bulky size, lack of haptic feedback, and no app lock features. The overall consensus is that it offers decent features at a competitive price but might not be a perfect choice for everyone. \n"

Now in M51 feature of Widevine L Certification you can enjoy all those global Dolby theatre experience.\n- Genuine Feedback to samsung and all buyersNot Upto the Mark..Battery is good, but mobile is very heavy.. not handy for one hand operation.. if you use it continuously then you feel pain in your  hand, designed is out dated, poor quality material.. camera is just okay..I am not happy overall performance of this phone at this price band...Mobile should be perfect for 15-16k price band..Lookwise not goodDisplay qaulity is just good not bestSound quality is goodCamera not much good that I am expecting.Big screen which perfect for movie watcher.. but after 30 minutes you feel pain in your hands.I bought Electric blue colour, it's look like samsung old samrt phone .My request to Amazon, is it possible to return this mobile.\n- Overall GOOD non Chinese phone.However, for their improvement, I tried to give some critical feedback to the company over phone but it was not so easy, so, I am writing here sothat Samsung India can take this critical review for their improvement.Battery:Battery is 7K mha but it is draining so fast that its overall backup time is slightly better than any other average phone.User Interface:User interface needs tremendous improvement. You can't take screenshot easily.\n- In this price segment, Samsung can easily provide metallic back for better appearance and transfer of heat.Overall, its good non chini phone with good camera and display, a bit bulky, satisfactory speed, scope of tremendous improvement in UI and setting, and bit overpriced.\n- When you focus on Sky whole pic turn into blue. i.e saturation level is too much high in this phone (Image attached).16. While watching movie video in this phone or playing video in youtube brightness fluctuate fast too much automatically i.e Adaptive Brightness issue.Pros :1. Super amoled plus display2. Camera quality Good3. 7000 Mah battery4.\n- No Carrier aggregation: Using Jio sim in Samsung M51 and realme X2 pro and both contain different net speed in which Samsung giving me 5mbps and realme x2 pro giving me 9-10mbps.14. Calling issue: while talking through ear piece on call, the person can hear my voice clearly. But if i put the call on loudspeaker, the receiver of call cant hear my voice or he hear my sound very low. Turning back to earpiece the person is able to hear me again.15.

Ordered on the first day of its sale and received on 3rd day. Indeed its a big and bulky phn but easy to handle. Few highlights:1. Seamless fingerprint scanner. I hv heard tht recent samsung phns have ths issue , however i dnt see any in ths phn. Its as gud as my past phns Asus 6z and Vivo v15pro. Side fingerprint scanner on the power button really makes it stylish and too easy to handle as well.2.\n- I am giving this review after spending 20 days with this Phone.
