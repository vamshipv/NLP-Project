    "summary": "The Samsung Galaxy M01 Core generally receives positive feedback, highlighting its good build quality, performance, and camera features.  However, some users express disappointment with aspects like battery life, display clarity in low light conditions, and the lack of expandable storage. Certain users also experience occasional software issues like automatic restarts or limited camera functionality. Overall, the phone is considered a decent budget option, especially for those looking for a sleek design and good performance within their price range.  \n"

    "summary": "Customer feedback on the Samsung Galaxy M01 Core highlights a mix of positive and negative aspects:\n\n**Positives:** \n\n* **High praise for build quality, design, performance, camera (in good lighting), fast charging, user experience (Android and One UI)**\n* **Many enjoy the sleekness and convenience of the phone's size.**\n* **Positive experiences with display, sound quality,  and battery life are common.**\n* **Quick delivery from Amazon is appreciated.**\n\n**Negatives:**\n\n* **Battery life is a recurring concern**, even though it's considered a good performer in many reviews. \n* **Users often point to camera struggles in low light and occasional screen flickering/display quality issues.**  Some mention the \"auto-switching off\" feature as an issue, although this seems rare. \n* **Limited SD card slot and missing earphones in the box are mentioned as drawbacks.** \n\n**Overall:** The Samsung Galaxy M01 Core appears to be a well-received phone for its price point with several positive features but also some potential areas for improvement regarding battery life, camera performance, and user experience.  \n\n\nIt's worth noting that customer reviews can be subjective, and individual experiences may vary. \n"

    "summary": "Customers generally praise the Samsung Galaxy M01 Core for its excellent build quality, sleek design, and good camera performance (though it struggles with low light). Some note positive features like a large battery (6000 mAh), fast charging, and impressive display.  Concerns include occasional unexpected shutdowns, battery drain despite advertised capacity, and average overall performance compared to more expensive flagships like the OnePlus 7T.  Overall, the M01 Core appears to be a well-received budget option with some caveats for demanding users. \n"

    "summary": "The Samsung Galaxy M01 Core receives generally positive reviews, with users praising its build quality, design, camera (particularly for daylight shots), and fast updates.  However, some complaints include the battery life's inconsistency, occasional overheating, and mediocre display quality in low-light conditions.  Several reviewers highlight the improved performance compared to previous M series models. A notable point is that many users have experienced issues with the phone automatically switching off and on, although Samsung has addressed this. \n"

Good lighting conditions result in beautiful and detailed shots. Struggles a bit during the low light conditions. Overall quite ok for the price.4.\n- After 1 month Use1.Look and Build quality Good2. Camera Quality and feature mind blowing3. Battery 33w fast charger too good..charge 10 to 100% in just  40 to 45 minutes4. Ram management super.Good for multitasking...5. Display E3 Super Amoled,picture quality very nice stream any video in full HD like Amazon prime video, Netflix6. Audio output very clear and Loud7. Network Quality Good8. Lot of New AI feature provide in this phoneOverall This smartphone fulfill my all Technical Needs...Good work\n- Its not working. Pls don't buy this phone. Listen carefully, Only on August 14th 2020 I bought this, but today 23.08.2020 its not working. I couldn't even switch this mobile on. Samsung Galaxy M01 mobile. Mobile is not worth. As today I came to amazon for return or replacement this cheater has closed the return window by yesterday. How cunning they are ? not even ten days its been since I have bought. This cheaters have closed it. Its not working now. Even if I call toll free numbers no one responses.\n- The fault is from the end of Samsung company I suppose, because they should mention the process on the front page with bold letter. Most of the reviews which get 1 star facing the same problems like of mine. After using one month I want to add some extra points which impressed me.1. Sound quality and graphics are very good.2. Smooth touch sensitivity3. Ringtones are much louder.4.Two volte nano SIM s work fine together.5.Battery backup is good.\n- I received One Plus 7T 2 days back. I will describe you my experience in these 2 days.Firstly, kudos to Amazon for such a quick delivery and excellent packaging.Coming to the mobile, the first impression is just amazing. Its smooth, fast and you can't come out of it.The amoeld display is stunning and camera is amazing. Battery backup is also too good.\n- Video - Haven't really used much.Will update later3)Dolby speakers - Excellent sound quality with awesome stereo effect.Once again a huge upgrade over the older models.4)90 Hz refresh rate - Yes this one gives you a totally different experience when using your mobile.It is clearly faster and better than the usual 60Hz displays.5)Build and design - Just perfect...It's sleek...stylish and neat.\n- and i purchased this phone for my mom so quad core porcessor is sufficient to my mom.2:- Battry life is good because of Quad Core Processor.3:- Ram is 2Gb that is also sufficient4:- Display as always awesome as samsung provide.5:- Mike and Speaker's quality is too good as always samsung provide.6:- Many People said in the review that the mobile is automatically swiched off and on automatically. yes i have seen this my own only one time. but its not the problem.\n- Strongly recommend No..why samsung make lot advertise on m31s.really don't know wt makes new compared to other M series. 'Single take' shot option really useless.People who r looking for camera please don't buy m31s.All the modes camers pictures are 95%blur mode.perfomance of mobile is not up to expectations.When turns into selife mode really shocked IS IT HD photo or Asian paints colored WALL.REALLY SHOCKED.THIS TIME SAMSUNG DISAPPOINTED.Videos display is also not so effective.\n- (Using 8 GB ram variant)\u2206 WHAT'S INSIDE THE BOX \u2206The box looks like any other mobile phone box , nothing much fancy .Inside the box we get1) Device itself2)User manual and some paperwork.3)Dash charger and cable.\u2206 PROS\u22061) Design-It's a pro or con depending on each user's, if you look pass the Appleish design the build quality is amazing .It has curved back which feels really good when you hold it in hand.2)Top notch specs.3) Stock Android with minimal bloat and fast updates (I have received 3 till now)4)No-heating issues-I have used this device for many days and I must say this device barely heats up while doing intensive tasks, thanks to the Snapdragon 835.5) Excellent Camera-Day light photography is excellent but in low light it's a hit or a miss.6)Fast fingerprint scanner.\u2206CONS\u22061) Display is still Full hd2) Battery is not that great even with Full hd display (This could be fixed with an  software update)3)No Sd card slot.4) Price could have been less.Overall Iam pretty happy with the device and I highly recommend this to anyone over honor 8 pro.Thanks \u270c\ufe0f\n- Gifted it for my mother. It is perfect size , perfect placement of power and volume buttons, has dust on phone after opening the box but the box was sealed, same thing happened to me when I bought M31,Pros. * Perfect size* Samsung brand* Good build quality for this price* Android 10* One UI 2Cons. * camera is below average* Average display quality* No earphones in the box* No fingerprint scanner* Takes very long time to charge battery.Will update this review after few weeks.\n\n**Summary:**",
    "summary": "Customer feedback on the Samsung Galaxy M01 showcases a mixed bag of opinions.  Many praise its good build quality, performance (thanks to the Snapdragon 835 processor), and solid display. The camera, while decent in good light, struggles in low light conditions. Battery life is also a point of contention, with some users finding it underwhelming. While overall satisfaction is reported, concerns about display quality and battery longevity surface. However,  a general sentiment of positive reception emerges due to the phone's value for money proposition and its user-friendly Android experience. \n"

Some appreciate its ease of use, durability, good display, and solid performance for everyday tasks. There's also a general sentiment that this phone represents good value for money in the Indian market, especially against Chinese brands. \n\n**Negatives:** Concerns include slow charging time, camera quality not being as good as other phones in this price range, occasional automatic shutdowns, and inconsistent build quality (some experience issues with plastic body). Notably, some reviewers encounter difficulties using the phone after purchase.\n\n\nOverall, the Samsung Galaxy M01 is a decent budget option for those seeking a basic but reliable phone without sacrificing essential features. However, buyers should be aware of potential drawbacks and consider their individual needs before making a purchase.  \n"
